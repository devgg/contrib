supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.\n</p><p>A successor to the programming language <i>B</i>, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n</p><p>C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.

a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use. It is an imperative, procedural and, since 2002, object-oriented language. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. However, due to its declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages or replaced with software packages. Most programming in COBOL is now purely to maintain existing applications; however, many large financial institutions were still developing new systems in COBOL as late as 2006.</p><p>COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on the programming language FLOW-MATIC designed by Grace Hopper. It was created as part of a US Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing. It was originally seen as a stopgap, but the Department of Defense promptly forced computer manufacturers to provide it, resulting in its widespread adoption. It was standardized in 1968 and has since been revised four times. Expansions include support for structured and object-oriented programming. The current standard is <i>ISO/IEC 1989:2014</i>.</p><p>COBOL statements have an English-like syntax, which was designed to be self-documenting and highly readable. However, it is verbose and uses over 300 reserved words. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like <code class="mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-c mw-content-ltr" id="" style="" dir="ltr"><span>y</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>;</span><span></span></code>, COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, <code class="mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-cobolfree mw-content-ltr" id="" style="" dir="ltr"><span>MOVE</span> <span>x</span> <span>TO</span> <span>y</span></code>).\nCOBOL code is split into four <i>divisions</i> (identification, environment, data, and procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs and sentences. Lacking a large standard library, the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions and just one class.\n</p><p>Academic computer scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were not involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.\nCOBOL has been criticized throughout its life for its verbosity, design process, and poor support for structured programming. These weaknesses result in monolithic, verbose (intended to be English-like) programs that are not easily comprehensible.\n</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/COBOL_Report_Apr60.djvu/page1-2368px-COBOL_Report_Apr60.djvu.jpg",repositories:[]},{name:"cpp",summary_html:'<p class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>\n<p><b>C++</b> (<span></span>) is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.</p><p>C++ was designed with an orientation toward systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).</p><p>C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as <i>ISO/IEC 14882:2020</i> (informally known as C++20). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as <i>ISO/IEC 14882:1998</i>, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library.  Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned standard.</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg/306px-ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"electron/electron",url:"https://github.com/electron/electron",description:":electron:

C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.</p><p>C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.\n</p><p>As of 2021, the most recent version of the language is C# 10.0, which was released in 2021 in .NET 6.0.</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/C_Sharp_wordmark.svg/512px-C_Sharp_wordmark.svg.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"dotnet/aspnetcore",url:"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore",description:"ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform .NET framework for building modern cloud-based web applications on Windows, Mac, or Linux.",homepage_url:"https://asp.net",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9141961?s=80&v=4",num_forks:7543,num_issues:143,num_pull_requests:44,num_stars:27512,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:99,color:"156724"},{name:"good first issue",count:10,color:"fef2c0"}],issues:[],languages:["Batchfile","Shell","Dockerfile","C#","PowerShell","Python","Makefile","Roff","C++","C"]},{name_with_owner:"files-community/Files",url:"https://github.com/files-community/Files",description:"A modern file manager for Windows",homepage_url:"https://files.community",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65931357?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1186,num_issues:73,num_pull_requests:16,num_stars:21196,labels:[{name:"good first issue",count:56,color:"8B3A98"},{name:"help wanted",count:17,color:"f97cb1"}],issues:[],languages:["C#","Smalltalk","C++","C"]},{name_with_owner:"dotnet/roslyn",url:"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn",description:"The Roslyn .NET compiler provides C# and Visual Basic languages with rich code analysis APIs.",homepage_url:"https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9141961?s=80&v=4",num_forks:3554,num_issues:1663,num_pull_requests:417,num_stars:15605,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:100,color:"0e8a16"}],issues:[],languages:["PowerShell","C#","Shell","C++","F#","Batchfile","1C Enterprise","CMake","Visual Basic .NET","Dockerfile"]},{name_with_owner:"AvaloniaUI/Avalonia",url:"https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia",description:"A cross-platform UI framework for .NET",homepage_url:"https://avaloniaui.net",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14075148?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1194,num_issues:40,num_pull_requests:30,num_stars:13252,labels:[{name:"up-for-grabs",count:40,color:"009800"}],issues:[],languages:["C#","PowerShell","Shell","C++","Objective-C++","Objective-C","C","TypeScript","HTML","JavaScript"]},{name_with_owner:"MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit",url:"https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit",description:"Google's Material Design in XAML & WPF, for C# & VB.Net.

It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers <i>write once, run anywhere</i> (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client\u2013server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p><p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems\' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions. \n</p><p>As of October\xa02021, Java\xa017 is the latest version. Java 8, 11 and 17 are the current long-term support (LTS) versions. Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java\xa08 with public updates for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that are still receiving security and other upgrades.\n</p><p>Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions of Java, due to unresolved security issues in older versions. Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to a supported version, such as one of the LTS versions (8, 11, 17).\n</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg/234px-Java_programming_language_logo.svg.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"Snailclimb/JavaGuide",url:"https://github.com/Snailclimb/JavaGuide",description:"\u300cJava\u5b66\u4e60+\u9762\u8bd5\u6307\u5357\u300d\u4e00\u4efd\u6db5\u76d6\u5927\u90e8\u5206

and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users\' devices.\n</p><p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).\n</p><p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.\n</p><p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.\n</p><p>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.\n</p>\n\n\x3c!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1398\nCached time: 20220311223545\nCache expiry: 1814400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: [vary\u2010revision\u2010sha1, vary\u2010revision\u2010exists]\nCPU time usage: 0.485 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.611 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 1581/1000000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 44165/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 6607/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 21/100\nExpensive parser function count: 10/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 20331/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.313/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 7698799/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400\n--\x3e\n\x3c!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  573.483      1 -total\n 57.54%  329.993      2 Template:Infobox\n 50.85%  291.629      1 Template:Infobox_programming_language\n 37.60%  215.642      1 Template:Infobox_software/simple\n 30.86%  176.951      4 Template:Wikidata\n 11.00%   63.081      1 Template:Pp-pc1\n 10.97%   62.935      1 Template:Distinguish\n  8.41%   48.243      1 Template:Short_description\n  7.72%   44.254      3 Template:Start_date_and_age\n  4.74%   27.166      1 Template:IPAc-en\n--\x3e',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/JavaScript_screenshot.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp",url:"https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp",description:"freeCodeCamp.org's open-source codebase and curriculum.

While it is a general-purpose language and can be used to write any application, many of its features are well suited for numerical analysis and computational science.</p><p>Distinctive aspects of Julia\'s design include a type system with parametric polymorphism in a dynamic programming language; with multiple dispatch as its core programming paradigm. Julia supports concurrent, (composable) parallel and distributed computing (with or without using MPI or the built-in corresponding to "OpenMP-style" threads), and direct calling of C and Fortran libraries without glue code. Julia uses a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that is referred to as "just-ahead-of-time" (JAOT) in the Julia community, as Julia compiles all code (by default) to machine code before running it.</p><p>Julia is garbage-collected, uses eager evaluation, and includes efficient libraries for floating-point calculations, linear algebra, random number generation, and regular expression matching. Many libraries are available, including some (e.g., for fast Fourier transforms) that were previously bundled with Julia and are now separate.</p><p>Several development tools support coding in Julia, such as integrated development environments (e.g. Microsoft\'s Visual Studio Code, with extensions available adding Julia support to IDEs, e.g. providing debugging and linting support); with integrated tools, e.g. a profiler (and flame graph support available for the built-in one), debugger, and the Rebugger.jl package "supports repeated-execution debugging" and more.</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Julia_Programming_Language_Logo.svg/512px-Julia_Programming_Language_Logo.svg.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"JuliaLang/julia",url:"https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia",description:"The Julia Programming Language",homepage_url:"https://julialang.org/",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/743164?s=80&v=4",num_forks:4835,num_issues:168,num_pull_requests:842,num_stars:38509,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:79,color:"0b02e1"},{name:"good first issue",count:35,color:"0052cc"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","Makefile","Julia","C++","Scheme","C","Clojure","Objective-C","Assembly","GDB"]},{name_with_owner:"fonsp/Pluto.jl",url:"https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl",description:"\ud83c\udf88 Simple reactive notebooks for Julia",homepage_url:"https://binder.plutojl.org/",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6933510?s=80&u=d7bc89d7d2012c20a9880a1d9b77ed0477eb89b1&v=4",num_forks:223,num_issues:28,num_pull_requests:36,num_stars:3703,labels:[{name:"good first issue",count:28,color:"7057ff"}],issues:[],languages:["HTML","Julia","CSS","JavaScript"]},{name_with_owner:"FluxML/Flux.jl",url:"https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl",description:"Relax!

Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin\'s standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React) or native code via LLVM (e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps). Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.</p><p>On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android app developers. Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler. The Android Kotlin compiler produces Java 8 bytecode by default (which runs in any later JVM), but lets the programmer choose to target Java 9 up to 17, for optimization, or allows for more features; has bidirectional record class interoperability support for JVM, introduced in Java 16, considered stable as of Kotlin 1.5.\n</p><p>Kotlin support for compilation directly to JavaScript (i.e., the classic back-end) is considered stable since version 1.3, while the new Kotlin/JS(IR) is in beta as of version 1.5.30. The new optimized implementations of Kotlin/JVM(IR) and Kotlin/JS (IR-based) were introduced in version 1.4. Kotlin/JVM(IR) is considered stable and enabled by default since version 1.5. Kotlin/Native (for e.g. Apple silicon support) is considered beta since version 1.3.</p>',image_url:"",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"Kr328/ClashForAndroid",url:"https://github.com/Kr328/ClashForAndroid",description:"A rule-based tunnel for Android.",homepage_url:"",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39107975?s=80&u=37ba4eaa7bd1c4039d7f051f8cc5fac6978e2fcc&v=4",num_forks:1602,num_issues:22,num_pull_requests:5,num_stars:12207,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:22,color:"008672"}],issues:[],languages:["Kotlin","CMake","C","Go","Java"]},{name_with_owner:"sourcerer-io/sourcerer-app",url:"https://github.com/sourcerer-io/sourcerer-app",description:"\ud83e\udd84 Sourcerer app makes a visual profile from your GitHub and git repositories.",homepage_url:"https://sourcerer.io/start",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29913589?s=80&v=4",num_forks:277,num_issues:17,num_pull_requests:1,num_stars:6665,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:17,color:"128A0C"},{name:"good first issue",count:15,color:"11559e"},{name:"easy",count:4,color:"c61bd6"}],issues:[],languages:["Kotlin","Shell","Groovy","Dockerfile"]},{name_with_owner:"mozilla-mobile/fenix",url:"https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix",description:"Firefox for Android",homepage_url:"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22351667?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1092,num_issues:39,num_pull_requests:87,num_stars:5670,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:29,color:"008672"},{name:"good first issue",count:18,color:"7057ff"}],issues:[],languages:["Kotlin","Dockerfile","Python","Shell","CSS","HTML","Java","Ruby","JavaScript"]},{name_with_owner:"detekt/detekt",url:"https://github.com/detekt/detekt",description:"Static code analysis for Kotlin",homepage_url:"https://detekt.dev",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57960713?s=80&v=4",num_forks:597,num_issues:59,num_pull_requests:12,num_stars:4365,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:59,color:"128A0C"},{name:"good first issue",count:4,color:"9AEE09"}],issues:[],languages:["Kotlin","HTML","CSS","Shell","Java"]},{name_with_owner:"intellij-rust/intellij-rust",url:"https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust",description:"Rust plugin for the IntelliJ Platform",homepage_url:"https://intellij-rust.github.io",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16057867?s=80&v=4",num_forks:336,num_issues:32,num_pull_requests:90,num_stars:3865,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:31,color:"207de5"},{name:"E-easy",count:3,color:"0e8a16"}],issues:[],languages:["Java","Kotlin","Lex","Rust","RenderScript","HTML","Shell","Python"]},{name_with_owner:"corda/corda",url:"https://github.com/corda/corda",description:"Corda is an open source blockchain project, designed for business from the start.

"Perl" refers to Perl 5, but from 2000 to 2019 it also referred to its redesigned "sister language", Perl 6, before the latter\'s name was officially changed to Raku in October 2019.</p><p>Though Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms in use, including "Practical Extraction and Reporting Language". Perl was developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Raku, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from each other.\n</p><p>The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, sh, AWK, and sed; They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools. Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its powerful regular expression and string parsing abilities.</p><p>In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for GUIs. It has been nicknamed "the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages" because of its flexibility and power, and also its ugliness. In 1998, it was also referred to as the "duct tape that holds the Internet together," in reference to both its ubiquitous use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.</p><p>Perl is a highly expressive programming language: source code for a given algorithm can be short and highly compressible.</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/56/Perl_language_logo.svg/316px-Perl_language_logo.svg.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"mojolicious/mojo",url:"https://github.com/mojolicious/mojo",description:":sparkles: Mojolicious - Perl real-time web framework",homepage_url:"https://mojolicious.org",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388868?s=80&v=4",num_forks:546,num_issues:13,num_pull_requests:14,num_stars:2315,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:13,color:"1D094C"},{name:"good first issue",count:2,color:"77ff75"}],issues:[],languages:["Perl","XProc","Mathematica","CSS"]},{name_with_owner:"OpenKore/openkore",url:"https://github.com/OpenKore/openkore",description:"A free/open source client and automation tool for Ragnarok Online",homepage_url:"http://openkore.com",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/621950?s=80&v=4",num_forks:964,num_issues:12,num_pull_requests:28,num_stars:1038,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:12,color:"fbca04"}],issues:[],languages:["Makefile","Python","Perl","Shell","C","C++","HTML","CSS","JavaScript","Batchfile"]},{name_with_owner:"asbru-cm/asbru-cm",url:"https://github.com/asbru-cm/asbru-cm",description:"\xc1sbr\xfa Connection Manager is a user interface that helps organizing remote terminal sessions and automating repetitive tasks.",homepage_url:"https://www.asbru-cm.net/",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31277293?s=80&v=4",num_forks:110,num_issues:14,num_pull_requests:1,num_stars:719,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:14,color:"128A0C"}],issues:[],languages:["Perl","Roff","Shell","Python","CSS","Raku"]},{name_with_owner:"openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server",url:"https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server",description:"Open Food Facts database and web interface - \ud83d\udc2a\ud83e\udd8b Perl, CSS and JS coders welcome \ud83d\ude0a For helping in Python, see Robotoff",homepage_url:"",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937790?s=80&v=4",num_forks:189,num_issues:31,num_pull_requests:84,num_stars:417,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:24,color:"33aa3f"},{name:"good first issue",count:7,color:"7057ff"}],issues:[],languages:["CSS","HTML","JavaScript","Perl","Shell","Dockerfile","Python","XSLT","SCSS","Makefile"]},{name_with_owner:"UPC/ravada",url:"https://github.com/UPC/ravada",description:"Remote Virtual Desktops Manager",homepage_url:"https://ravada.upc.edu/",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3529716?s=80&v=4",num_forks:151,num_issues:16,num_pull_requests:4,num_stars:325,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:12,color:"128A0C"},{name:"good first issue",count:6,color:"5319e7"}],issues:[],languages:["Perl","CSS","JavaScript","Makefile","Shell","HTML","Raku","Dockerfile"]},{name_with_owner:"xcat2/xcat-core",url:"https://github.com/xcat2/xcat-core",description:"Code repo for xCAT core packages",homepage_url:"",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10124414?s=80&v=4",num_forks:160,num_issues:13,num_pull_requests:19,num_stars:302,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:13,color:"82c425"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","Perl","Makefile","C","Python","PHP","CSS","JavaScript","HTML","Awk"]},{name_with_owner:"aspiers/stow",url:"https://github.com/aspiers/stow",description:"GNU Stow - mirror of savannah git repository occasionally with more bleeding-edge branches",homepage_url:"http://www.gnu.org/s/stow/",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100738?s=80&v=4",num_forks:32,num_issues:10,num_pull_requests:6,num_stars:299,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:9,color:"0e8a16"},{name:"easy",count:1,color:"f9d0c4"}],issues:[],languages:["Perl","Makefile","M4","Shell","Dockerfile"]}]},{name:"php",summary_html:'<p class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>\n<p><b>PHP</b> is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for <i><b>Personal Home Page</b></i>, but it now stands for the recursive initialism <i><b>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</b></i>.</p><p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.  On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code\xa0\u2013  which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data\xa0\u2013  would form the whole or part of an HTTP response.  Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.\n</p><p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.</p><p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the <i>de facto</i> standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.</p><p>W3Techs reports that, as of January\xa02022, "PHP is used by 78.1% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know."

Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but can guarantee memory safety by using a <i>borrow checker</i> to validate references. Rust achieves memory safety without garbage collection, and reference counting is optional. Rust has been called a systems programming language, and in addition to high-level features such as functional programming it also offers mechanisms for low-level memory management.\n</p><p>First appearing in 2010, Rust was designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others. The designers refined the language while writing the Servo experimental browser engine and the Rust compiler. Rust\'s major influences include C++, OCaml, Haskell, and Erlang. It has gained increasing use and investment in industry, by companies including Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Facebook (Meta), Google (Alphabet), and Microsoft.\n</p><p>Rust has been voted the "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016, and was used by 7% of the respondents in 2021.</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Rust_programming_language_black_logo.svg/144px-Rust_programming_language_black_logo.svg.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"denoland/deno",url:"https://github.com/denoland/deno",description:"A

Designed to be concise, many of Scala\'s design decisions are aimed to address criticisms of Java.</p><p>Scala source code can be compiled to Java bytecode and run on a Java virtual machine (JVM). Scala provides language interoperability with Java so that libraries written in either language may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code. Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a syntax termed <i>curly-brace</i> which is similar to the language C. Since Scala 3, there is also an option to use the off-side rule (indenting) to structure blocks, and its use is advised. Martin Odersky has said that this turned out to be the most productive change introduced in Scala 3.</p><p>Unlike Java, Scala has many features of functional programming languages like Scheme, Standard ML, and Haskell, including currying, immutability, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching. It also has an advanced type system supporting algebraic data types, covariance and contravariance, higher-order types (but not higher-rank types), and anonymous types. Other features of Scala not present in Java include operator overloading, optional parameters, named parameters, and raw strings. Conversely, a feature of Java not in Scala is checked exceptions, which has proved controversial.</p><p>The name Scala is a portmanteau of <i>scalable</i> and <i>language</i>, signifying that it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.</p>',image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Scala-full-color.svg/512px-Scala-full-color.svg.png",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"playframework/playframework",url:"https://github.com/playframework/playframework",description:"Play Framework",homepage_url:"http://www.playframework.com/",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/319107?s=80&v=4",num_forks:4018,num_issues:91,num_pull_requests:66,num_stars:12098,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:78,color:"7057ff"},{name:"good first issue",count:36,color:"7057ff"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","Scala","Java","HTML","CSS","JavaScript","Roff","Less"]},{name_with_owner:"akka/akka",url:"https://github.com/akka/akka",description:"Build highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the JVM",homepage_url:"https://akka.io",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1496237?s=80&v=4",num_forks:3488,num_issues:239,num_pull_requests:42,num_stars:12078,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:100,color:"009800"}],issues:[],languages:["Scala","Java","Shell","Perl","JavaScript","Makefile","StringTemplate"]},{name_with_owner:"gitbucket/gitbucket",url:"https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket",description:"A Git platform powered by Scala with easy installation, high extensibility & GitHub API compatibility",homepage_url:"https://gitbucket.github.io/",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11145783?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1221,num_issues:35,num_pull_requests:31,num_stars:8605,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:35,color:"fbca04"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","Scala","Java","HTML","JavaScript","CSS"]},{name_with_owner:"twitter/finagle",url:"https://github.com/twitter/finagle",description:"A fault tolerant, protocol-agnostic RPC system",homepage_url:"https://twitter.github.io/finagle",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50278?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1393,num_issues:19,num_pull_requests:0,num_stars:8177,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:15,color:"0052cc"},{name:"good first issue",count:5,color:"009800"}],issues:[],languages:["Scala","Thrift","Java","Shell","Ruby","HTML","Lua","R","Starlark"]},{name_with_owner:"apache/openwhisk",url:"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk",description:"Apache OpenWhisk is an open source serverless cloud platform",homepage_url:"https://openwhisk.apache.org/",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1077,num_issues:37,num_pull_requests:33,num_stars:5595,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:29,color:"c2e0c6"},{name:"good first issue",count:19,color:"d4c5f9"},{name:"starter",count:1,color:"c5def5"}],issues:[],languages:["JavaScript","Shell","Swift","Scala","Python","Java","Groovy","Lua","Dockerfile","C#"]},{name_with_owner:"gatling/gatling",url:"https://github.com/gatling/gatling",description:"Modern Load Testing as Code",homepage_url:"https://gatling.io",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3863781?s=80&v=4",num_forks:1092,num_issues:18,num_pull_requests:1,num_stars:5466,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:18,color:"fbca04"},{name:"good first issue",count:1,color:"009800"}],issues:[],languages:["Shell","JavaScript","CSS","HTML","Scala","Batchfile","Java","Kotlin"]},{name_with_owner:"linkerd/linkerd",url:"https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd",description:"Old repo for Linkerd 1.x.

class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>\n<p><b>Swift</b> is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community. First released in 2014, Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple\'s earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple\'s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift\'s design was the ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades. It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library, which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.</p><p>Apple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably dynamic dispatch, widespread late binding, extensible programming and similar features, but in a "safer" way, making it easier to catch software bugs; Swift has features addressing some common programming errors like null pointer dereferencing and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the pyramid of doom. Swift supports the concept of protocol extensibility, an extensibility system that can be applied to types, structs and classes, which Apple promotes as a real change in programming paradigms they term "protocol-oriented programming" (similar to traits).</p><p>Swift was introduced at Apple\'s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). It underwent an upgrade to version 1.2 during 2014 and a major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. Initially a proprietary language, version 2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3, 2015, for Apple\'s platforms and Linux.</p><p>Through version 3.0 the syntax of Swift went through significant evolution, with the core team making source stability a focus in later versions. In the first quarter of 2018 Swift surpassed Objective-C in measured popularity.</p><p>Swift 4.0, released in 2017, introduced several changes to some built-in classes and structures. Code written with previous versions of Swift can be updated using the migration functionality built into Xcode. Swift 5, released in March 2019, introduced a stable binary interface on Apple platforms, allowing the Swift runtime to be incorporated into Apple operating systems. It is source compatible with Swift 4.</p><p>Swift 5.1 was officially released in September 2019. Swift 5.1 builds on the previous version of Swift 5 by extending the stable features of the language to compile-time with the introduction of module stability. The introduction of module stability makes it possible to create and share binary frameworks that will work with future releases of Swift.</p><p>Swift 5.5, officially announced by Apple at the 2021 WWDC, significantly expands language support for concurrency and asynchronous code, notably introducing a unique version of the actor model.</p>',image_url:"",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"danielgindi/Charts",url:"https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts",description:"Beautiful charts for iOS/tvOS/OSX!

This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.</p><p>The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. TypeScript is included as a first-class programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 and later, alongside C# and other Microsoft languages. An official extension allows Visual Studio 2012 to support TypeScript as well. Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript.</p>',image_url:"",repositories:[{name_with_owner:"microsoft/vscode",url:"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode",description:"Visual Studio Code",homepage_url:"https://code.visualstudio.com",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?s=80&v=4",num_forks:21795,num_issues:299,num_pull_requests:268,num_stars:128829,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:99,color:"fef2c0"},{name:"good first issue",count:4,color:"fef2c0"}],issues:[],languages:["JavaScript","TypeScript","Batchfile","Shell","CSS","HTML","PowerShell","Python","Inno Setup","Roff"]},{name_with_owner:"angular/angular",url:"https://github.com/angular/angular",description:"The modern web developer\u2019s platform",homepage_url:"https://angular.io",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/139426?s=80&v=4",num_forks:21080,num_issues:33,num_pull_requests:89,num_stars:80145,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:32,color:"008672"},{name:"good first issue",count:1,color:"7057ff"}],issues:[],languages:["JavaScript","HTML","CSS","Shell","TypeScript","PHP","Dockerfile","PowerShell","Starlark","SCSS"]},{name_with_owner:"ant-design/ant-design",url:"https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design",description:"An enterprise-class UI design language and React UI library",homepage_url:"https://ant.design",avatar_url:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12101536?s=80&v=4",num_forks:32937,num_issues:172,num_pull_requests:49,num_stars:78658,labels:[{name:"help wanted",count:100,color:"0e8a16"},{name:"good first issue",count:5,color:"9ef98e"}],issues:[],languages:["HTML","JavaScript","TypeScript","Shell","Less"]},{name_with_owner:"storybookjs/storybook",url:"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook",description:"\ud83d\udcd3 The UI component explorer.
