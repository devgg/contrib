(<i>pronounced</i> <span></span><i> \u2013 like the letter c</i>) is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C\'s features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems code (especially in kernels), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.\\n</p><p>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book <i>The C Programming Language</i>, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the <i>de facto</i> standard for the language. C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and, subsequently, jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\\n</p><p>C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.

Clojure\'s reader supports literal syntax for maps, sets and vectors along with lists, and these are compiled to the mentioned structures directly. Clojure treats code as data and has a Lisp macro system. Clojure is a Lisp-1 and is not intended to be code-compatible with other dialects of Lisp, since it uses its own set of data structures incompatible with other Lisps. \\n</p><p>Clojure advocates immutability and immutable data structures and encourages programmers to be explicit about managing identity and its states.

(<span></span>; an acronym for \\"common business-oriented language\\") is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use. It is an imperative, procedural, and, since 2002, object-oriented language. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. Many large financial institutions were developing new systems in the language as late as 2006, but most programming in COBOL today is purely to maintain existing applications. Programs are being moved to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages, or replaced with other software.\\n</p><p>COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on the programming language FLOW-MATIC, designed by Grace Hopper. It was created as part of a U.S. Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing. It was originally seen as a stopgap, but the Defense Department promptly pressured computer manufacturers to provide it, resulting in its widespread adoption. It was standardized in 1968 and has been revised five times. Expansions include support for structured and object-oriented programming. The current standard is ISO/IEC\xa01989:2023.\\n</p><p>COBOL statements have prose syntax such as <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-cobolfree mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>MOVE</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>TO</span><span> </span><span>y</span></code>, which was designed to be self-documenting and highly readable. However, it is verbose and uses over 300 reserved words. This contrasts with the succinct and mathematically inspired syntax of other languages (in this case, <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-c mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>y</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>;</span></code>).\\n</p><p>The COBOL code is split into four <i>divisions</i> (identification, environment, data, and procedure), containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs, and sentences. Lacking a large standard library, the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions, and just one class.\\n</p><p>Academic computer scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were not involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.\\n</p><p>COBOL has been criticized for its verbosity, design process, and poor support for structured programming. These weaknesses result in monolithic programs that are hard to comprehend as a whole, despite their local readability.\\n</p><p>For years, COBOL has been assumed as a programming language for business operations in mainframes, although in recent years, many COBOL operations have been moved to cloud computing.\\n</p>","image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/COBOL_Report_Apr60.djvu/page1-2368px-COBOL_Report_Apr60.djvu.jpg","repositories":[]},{"name":"cpp","summary_html":"<p class=\\"mw-empty-elt\\">\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><b>C++</b> (<span></span>, pronounced \\"<b>C plus plus</b>\\" and sometimes abbreviated as <b>CPP</b>) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997, C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation for systems like microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows. It is usually implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.\\n</p><p>C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g., e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g., telephone switches or space probes).\\n</p><p>C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as <i>ISO/IEC 14882:2020</i> (informally known as C++20). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as <i>ISO/IEC 14882:1998</i>, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current <span>C++20</span> standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned standard.\\n</p>","image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg/306px-ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg.png","repositories":[{"name_with_owner":"microsoft/terminal","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/terminal","description":"The new Windows Terminal and the original Windows console host, all in the same place!","homepage_url":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?s=80&v=4","num_forks":8174,"num_issues":485,"num_pull_requests":50,"num_stars":94401,"labels":[{"name":"good first issue","count":7,"color":"bbf28e"}],"issues":[],"languages":["C#","Batchfile","PowerShell","C++","C","Roff","Python","JavaScript","HTML","HLSL"]},{"name_with_owner":"godotengine/godot","url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot","description":"Godot Engine \u2013 Multi-platform 2D and 3D game engine","homepage_url":"https://godotengine.org","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6318500?s=80&v=4","num_forks":19494,"num_issues":10,"num_pull_requests":2705,"num_stars":86963,"labels":[{"name":"good first issue","count":10,"color":"99ffff"}],"issues":[],"languages":["C++","Python","Shell","Objective-C","Objective-C++","Java","JavaScript","C#","GLSL","CMake"]},{"name_with_owner":"bitcoin/bitcoin","url":"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin","description":"Bitcoin Core integration/staging tree","homepage_url":"https://bitcoincore.org/en/download","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/528860?s=80&v=4","num_forks":35659,"num_issues":11,"num_pull_requests":314,"num_stars":77278,"labels":[{"name":"good first issue","count":11,"color":"c2e0c6"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Shell","Python","Makefile","C++","C","HTML","Objective-C++","M4","Assembly","Scheme"]},{"name_with_owner":"swiftlang/swift","url":"https://github.com/swiftlang/swift","description":"The Swift Programming Language","homepage_url":"https://swift.org","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42816656?s=80&v=4","num_forks":10323,"num_issues":180,"num_pull_requests":875,"num_stars":67026,"labels":[{"name":"good first issue","count":100,"color":"136320"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Emacs Lisp","CMake","C","C++","Python","Swift","Objective-C++","DTrace","Objective-C","Shell"]},{"name_with_owner":"protocolbuffers/protobuf","url":"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf","description":"Protocol Buffers - Google\'s data interchange format","homepage_url":"http://protobuf.dev","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26310541?s=80&v=4","num_forks":15376,"num_issues":53,"num_pull_requests":99,"num_stars":64684,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":53,"color":"159818"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Makefile","Shell","Java","Emacs Lisp","C++","Python","Ruby","C","Objective-C","Swift"]},{"name_with_owner":"ggerganov/llama.cpp","url":"https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp","description":"LLM inference in C/C++","homepage_url":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1991296?s=80&u=28314d364d7c28f8ec232fadb767970d3ad74e7b&v=4","num_forks":8887,"num_issues":59,"num_pull_requests":240,"num_stars":61939,"labels":[{"name":"good first issue","count":37,"color":"7057ff"},{"name":"help wanted","count":32,"color":"008672"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Makefile","Python","C","C++","Shell","CMake","Dockerfile","Nix","Swift","Cuda"]},{"name_with_owner":"x64dbg/x64dbg","url":"https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg","description":"An open-source user mode debugger for Windows.

Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.\\n</p><p>As of November 2023, the most recent stable version of the language is C# 12.0, which was released in 2023 in .NET 8.0.\\n</p>","image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/C_Sharp_Logo_2023.svg/205px-C_Sharp_Logo_2023.svg.png","repositories":[{"name_with_owner":"dotnet/aspnetcore","url":"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore","description":"ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform .NET framework for building modern cloud-based web applications on Windows, Mac, or Linux.","homepage_url":"https://asp.net","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9141961?s=80&v=4","num_forks":9852,"num_issues":44,"num_pull_requests":95,"num_stars":34895,"labels":[{"name":"good first issue","count":33,"color":"fef2c0"},{"name":"help wanted","count":12,"color":"156724"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Batchfile","Shell","Dockerfile","C#","PowerShell","Python","Makefile","Roff","C++","C"]},{"name_with_owner":"Ryujinx/Ryujinx","url":"https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx","description":"Experimental Nintendo Switch Emulator written in C#","homepage_url":"https://www.ryujinx.org","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39036280?s=80&v=4","num_forks":3869,"num_issues":30,"num_pull_requests":95,"num_stars":33559,"labels":[{"name":"good first issue","count":30,"color":"d7ff75"}],"issues":[],"languages":["C#","GLSL","Python","Shell","Makefile","C","HLSL"]},{"name_with_owner":"files-community/Files","url":"https://github.com/files-community/Files","description":"Building the best file manager for Windows","homepage_url":"https://files.community","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65931357?s=80&v=4","num_forks":2121,"num_issues":54,"num_pull_requests":15,"num_stars":33136,"labels":[{"name":"good first issue","count":28,"color":"8B3A98"},{"name":"help wanted","count":26,"color":"f97cb1"}],"issues":[],"languages":["C#","C++","C","PowerShell"]},{"name_with_owner":"dotnet/maui","url":"https://github.com/dotnet/maui","description":".NET MAUI is the .NET Multi-platform App UI, a framework for building native device applications spanning mobile, tablet, and desktop.","homepage_url":"https://dot.net/maui","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9141961?s=80&v=4","num_forks":1687,"num_issues":42,"num_pull_requests":205,"num_stars":21870,"labels":[{"name":"good first issue","count":35,"color":"7057ff"},{"name":"help wanted","count":9,"color":"008672"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Batchfile","Java","C#","Makefile","CSS","HTML","PowerShell","Shell","JavaScript","CMake"]},{"name_with_owner":"dotnet/roslyn","url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn","description":"The Roslyn .NET compiler provides C# and Visual Basic languages with rich code analysis APIs.","homepage_url":"https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9141961?s=80&v=4","num_forks":3988,"num_issues":1530,"num_pull_requests":532,"num_stars":18743,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":100,"color":"0e8a16"}],"issues":[],"languages":["PowerShell","C#","Shell","C++","F#","Batchfile","1C Enterprise","CMake","Visual Basic .NET","Dockerfile"]},{"name_with_owner":"MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit","url":"https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit","description":"Google\'s Material Design in XAML & WPF, for C# & VB.Net.

It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. It is often referred to as <b>Golang</b> because of its former domain name, <code>golang.org</code>, but its proper name is Go.\\n</p><p>There are two major implementations:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>Google\'s self-hosting \\"gc\\" compiler toolchain, targeting multiple operating systems and WebAssembly.</li>\\n<li>gofrontend, a frontend to other compilers, with the <i>libgo</i> library. With GCC the combination is gccgo; with LLVM the combination is gollvm.</li></ul>\\n<p>A third-party source-to-source compiler, GopherJS, compiles Go to JavaScript for front-end web development.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases. The designers wanted to address criticisms of other languages in use at Google, but keep their useful characteristics:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>Static typing and run-time efficiency (like C)</li>\\n<li>Readability and usability (like Python)</li>\\n<li>High-performance networking and multiprocessing</li></ul>\\n<p>Its designers were primarily motivated by their shared dislike of C++.\\n</p><p>Go was publicly announced in November 2009, and version 1.0 was released in March 2012. Go is widely used in production at Google and in many other organizations and open-source projects.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>The Gopher mascot was introduced in 2009 for the open source launch of the language.  The design, by Ren\xe9e French, borrowed from a c. 2000 WFMU promotion.\\n</p><p>In November 2016, the Go and Go Mono fonts were released by type designers Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes specifically for use by the Go project. Go is a humanist sans-serif resembling Lucida Grande, and Go Mono is monospaced. Both fonts adhere to the WGL4 character set and were designed to be legible with a large x-height and distinct letterforms. Both Go and Go Mono adhere to the DIN 1450 standard by having a slashed zero, lowercase <code>l</code> with a tail, and an uppercase <code>I</code> with serifs.\\n</p><p>In April 2018, the original logo was redesigned by brand designer Adam Smith. The new logo is a modern, stylized GO slanting right with trailing streamlines. (The Gopher mascot remained the same.)\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The lack of support for generic programming in initial versions of Go drew considerable criticism. The designers expressed an openness to generic programming and noted that built-in functions <i>were</i> in fact type-generic, but are treated as special cases; Pike called this a weakness that might be changed at some point. The Google team built at least one compiler for an experimental Go dialect with generics, but did not release it.\\n</p><p>In August 2018, the Go principal contributors published draft designs for generic programming and error handling and asked users to submit feedback. However, the error handling proposal was eventually abandoned.\\n</p><p>In June 2020, a new draft design document was published that would add the necessary syntax to Go for declaring generic functions and types. A code translation tool, <i><span>go2go</span></i>, was provided to allow users to try the new syntax, along with a generics-enabled version of the online Go Playground.\\n</p><p>Generics were finally added to Go in version 1.18 on March 15, 2022.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Go 1 guarantees compatibility for the language specification and major parts of the standard library. All versions up through the current Go 1.22 release have maintained this promise.\\n</p><p>Go does not follow SemVer; rather, each major Go release is supported until there are two newer minor releases. Unlike most software, Go calls the second number in a version the major, i.e., in <code>1.x</code> <code>x</code> is the major version.  This is because Go plans to never reach 2.0, given that compatibility is one of language\'s major selling points.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Go is influenced by C (especially the Plan 9 dialect), but with an emphasis on greater simplicity and safety. It consists of:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>A syntax and environment adopting patterns more common in dynamic languages:\\n<ul><li>Optional concise variable declaration and initialization through type inference (<code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-go mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>x</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>0</span></code> instead of <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-go mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>var</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></code> or <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-go mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>var</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></code>)</li>\\n<li>Fast compilation</li>\\n<li>Remote package management (<code>go get</code>) and online package documentation</li></ul></li>\\n<li>Distinctive approaches to particular problems:\\n<ul><li>Built-in concurrency primitives: light-weight processes (goroutines), channels, and the <code>select</code> statement</li>\\n<li>An interface system in place of virtual inheritance, and type embedding instead of non-virtual inheritance</li>\\n<li>A toolchain that, by default, produces statically linked native binaries without external Go dependencies</li></ul></li>\\n<li>A desire to keep the language specification simple enough to hold in a programmer\'s head, in part by omitting features that are common in similar languages.</li></ul>\\n\\n<p>Go\'s syntax includes changes from C aimed at keeping code concise and readable. A combined declaration/initialization operator was introduced that allows the programmer to write <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-go mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>i</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>3</span></code> or <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-go mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>s</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>\\"Hello, world!\\"</span></code>, without specifying the types of variables used. This contrasts with C\'s <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-c mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>int</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>;</span></code> and <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-c mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>const</span><span> </span><span>char</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>\\"Hello, world!\\"</span><span>;</span></code>.\\n</p><p>Semicolons still terminate statements; but are implicit when the end of a line occurs.\\n</p><p>Methods may return multiple values, and returning a <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-go mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>result</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span></code> pair is the conventional way a method indicates an error to its caller in Go. Go adds literal syntaxes for initializing struct parameters by name and for initializing maps and slices. As an alternative to C\'s three-statement <code>for</code> loop, Go\'s <code>range</code> expressions allow concise iteration over arrays, slices, strings, maps, and channels.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Go has a number of built-in types, including numeric ones (<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>byte</span>, <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>int64</span>, <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>float32</span>, etc.), booleans, and byte strings (<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>string</span>). Strings are immutable; built-in operators and keywords (rather than functions) provide concatenation, comparison, and UTF-8 encoding/decoding. Record types can be defined with the <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>struct</span> keyword.\\n</p><p>For each type <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span><i>T</i></span> and each non-negative integer constant <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span><i>n</i></span>, there is an array type denoted <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>[<i>n</i>]<i>T</i></span>; arrays of differing lengths are thus of different types. Dynamic arrays are available as \\"slices\\", denoted <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>[]<i>T</i></span> for some type <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span><i>T</i></span>. These have a length and a <i>capacity</i> specifying when new memory needs to be allocated to expand the array.

There is no pointer arithmetic, except via the special <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>unsafe.Pointer</span> type in the standard library.\\n</p><p>For a pair of types <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span><i>K</i></span>, <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span><i>V</i></span>, the type <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>map[<i>K</i>]<i>V</i></span> is the type mapping type-<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span><i>K</i></span> keys to type-<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span><i>V</i></span> values, though Go Programming Language specification does not give any performance guarantees or implementation requirements for map types. Hash tables are built into the language, with special syntax and built-in functions. <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>chan <i> T</i></span> is a <i>channel</i> that allows sending values of type <i>T</i> between concurrent Go processes.\\n</p><p>Aside from its support for interfaces, Go\'s type system is nominal: the <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>type</span> keyword can be used to define a new <i>named type</i>, which is distinct from other named types that have the same layout (in the case of a <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>struct</span>, the same members in the same order). Some conversions between types (e.g., between the various integer types) are pre-defined and adding a new type may define additional conversions, but conversions between named types must always be invoked explicitly. For example, the <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>type</span> keyword can be used to define a type for IPv4 addresses, based on 32-bit unsigned integers as follows:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>With this type definition, <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>ipv4addr(x)</span> interprets the <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>uint32</span> value <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>x</span> as an IP address. Simply assigning <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>x</span> to a variable of type <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>ipv4addr</span> is a type error.\\n</p><p><i>Constant expressions</i> may be either typed or \\"untyped\\"; they are given a type when assigned to a typed variable if the value they represent passes a compile-time check.\\n</p><p><i>Function types</i> are indicated by the <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>func</span> keyword; they take zero or more parameters and return zero or more values, all of which are typed. The parameter and return values determine a function type; thus, <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>func(string, int32) (int, error)</span> is the type of functions that take a <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>string</span> and a 32-bit signed integer, and return a signed integer (of default width) and a value of the built-in interface type <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>error</span>.\\n</p><p>Any named type has a method set associated with it. The IP address example above can be extended with a method for checking whether its value is a known standard:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Due to nominal typing, this method definition adds a method to <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>ipv4addr</span>, but not on <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>uint32</span>.

An object which is of an interface type is also of another type, much like C++ objects being simultaneously of a base and derived class. Go interfaces were designed after protocols from the Smalltalk programming language. Multiple sources use the term duck typing when describing Go interfaces. Although the term duck typing is not precisely defined and therefore not wrong, it usually implies that type conformance is not statically checked. Because conformance to a Go interface is checked statically by the Go compiler (except when performing a type assertion), the Go authors prefer the term <i>structural typing</i>.\\n</p><p>The definition of an interface type lists required methods by name and type. Any object of type T for which functions exist matching all the required methods of interface type I is an object of type I as well. The definition of type T need not (and cannot) identify type I. For example, if <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Shape</span>, <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Square</span> <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>and Circle</span> are defined as\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>then both a <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Square</span> and a <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Circle</span> are implicitly a <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Shape</span> and can be assigned to a <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Shape</span>-typed variable.<sup class=\\"reference nowrap\\"><span title=\\"Page / location: 263\u2013268\\">:\u200a263\u2013268\u200a</span></sup> In formal language, Go\'s interface system provides structural rather than nominal typing. Interfaces can embed other interfaces with the effect of creating a combined interface that is satisfied by exactly the types that implement the embedded interface and any methods that the newly defined interface adds.<sup class=\\"reference nowrap\\"><span title=\\"Page / location: 270\\">:\u200a270\u200a</span></sup>\\n</p><p>The Go standard library uses interfaces to provide genericity in several places, including the input/output system that is based on the concepts of <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Reader</span> and <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Writer</span>.<sup class=\\"reference nowrap\\"><span title=\\"Page / location: 282\u2013283\\">:\u200a282\u2013283\u200a</span></sup>\\n</p><p>\\nBesides calling methods via interfaces, Go allows converting interface values to other types with a run-time type check. The language constructs to do so are the <i>type assertion</i>, which checks against a single potential type:</p><p>and the <i>type switch</i>, which checks against multiple types:</p><p>The <i>empty interface</i> <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-go mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>interface</span><span>{}</span></code> is an important base case because it can refer to an item of <i>any</i> concrete type. It is similar to the <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Object</span> class in Java or C# and is satisfied by any type, including built-in types like <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>int</span>.<sup class=\\"reference nowrap\\"><span title=\\"Page / location: 284\\">:\u200a284\u200a</span></sup> Code using the empty interface cannot simply call methods (or built-in operators) on the referred-to object, but it can store the <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-go mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>interface</span><span>{}</span></code> value, try to convert it to a more useful type via a type assertion or type switch, or inspect it with Go\'s <code>reflect</code> package. Because <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-go mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>interface</span><span>{}</span></code> can refer to any value, it is a limited way to escape the restrictions of static typing, like <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-c mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>void</span><span>*</span></code> in C but with additional run-time type checks.\\n</p><p>The <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-go mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>interface</span><span>{}</span></code> type can be used to model structured data of any arbitrary schema in Go, such as JSON or YAML data, by representing it as a <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-go mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>interface</span><span>{}</span></code> (map of string to empty interface). This recursively describes data in the form of a dictionary with string keys and values of any type.\\n</p><p>Interface values are implemented using pointer to data and a second pointer to run-time type information. Like some other types implemented using pointers in Go, interface values are <code>nil</code> if uninitialized.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Since version 1.18, Go supports generic code using parameterized types.\\n</p><p>Functions and types now have the ability to be generic using type parameters. These type parameters are specified within square brackets, right after the function or type name. The compiler transforms the generic function or type into non-generic by substituting <i>type arguments</i> for the type parameters provided, either explicitly by the user or type inference by the compiler. This transformation process is referred to as type instantiation.\\n</p><p>\\nInterfaces now can define a set of types (known as type set) using <code>|</code> (Union) operator, as well as a set of methods. These changes were made to support type constraints in generics code. For a generic function or type, a constraint can be thought of as the type of the type argument: a meta-type. This new <code>~T</code> syntax will be the first use of <code>~</code> as a token in Go. <code>~T</code> means the set of all types whose underlying type is <code>T</code>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In Go\'s package system, each package has a path (e.g., <code>\\"compress/bzip2\\"</code> or <code>\\"golang.org/x/net/html\\"</code>) and a name (e.g., <code>bzip2</code> or <code>html</code>). References to other packages\' definitions must <i>always</i> be prefixed with the other package\'s name, and only the <i>capitalized</i> names from other packages are accessible: <code>io.Reader</code> is public but <code>bzip2.reader</code> is not. The <code>go get</code> command can retrieve packages stored in a remote repository and developers are encouraged to develop packages inside a base path corresponding to a source repository (such as example.com/user_name/package_name) to reduce the likelihood of name collision with future additions to the standard library or other external libraries.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The Go language has built-in facilities, as well as library support, for writing concurrent programs. Concurrency refers not only to CPU parallelism, but also to asynchrony: letting slow operations like a database or network read run while the program does other work, as is common in event-based servers.\\n</p><p>The primary concurrency construct is the <i>goroutine</i>, a type of green thread.<sup class=\\"reference nowrap\\"><span title=\\"Pages: 280\u2013281\\">:\u200a280\u2013281\u200a</span></sup> A function call prefixed with the <code>go</code> keyword starts a function in a new goroutine. The language specification does not specify how goroutines should be implemented, but current implementations multiplex a Go process\'s goroutines onto a smaller set of operating-system threads, similar to the scheduling performed in Erlang.<sup class=\\"reference nowrap\\"><span title=\\"Page / location: 10\\">:\u200a10\u200a</span></sup>\\n</p><p>While a standard library package featuring most of the classical concurrency control structures (mutex locks, etc.) is available,<sup class=\\"reference nowrap\\"><span title=\\"Page / location: 151\u2013152\\">:\u200a151\u2013152\u200a</span></sup> idiomatic concurrent programs instead prefer <i>channels</i>, which send messages between goroutines. Optional buffers store messages in FIFO order<sup class=\\"reference nowrap\\"><span title=\\"Page / location: 43\\">:\u200a43\u200a</span></sup> and allow sending goroutines to proceed before their messages are received.<sup class=\\"reference nowrap\\"><span title=\\"Page: 233\\">:\u200a233\u200a</span></sup>\\n</p><p>Channels are typed, so that a channel of type <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>chan <i>T</i></span> can only be used to transfer messages of type <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span><i>T</i></span>. Special syntax is used to operate on them; <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>&lt;-ch</span> is an expression that causes the executing goroutine to block until a value comes in over the channel <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>ch</span>, while <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>ch &lt;- x</span> sends the value <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>x</span> (possibly blocking until another goroutine receives the value). The built-in <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>switch</span>-like <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>select</span> statement can be used to implement non-blocking communication on multiple channels; see below for an example. Go has a memory model describing how goroutines must use channels or other operations to safely share data.\\n</p><p>The existence of channels does not by itself set Go apart from actor model-style concurrent languages like Erlang, where messages are addressed directly to actors (corresponding to goroutines). In the actor model, channels are themselves actors, therefore addressing a channel just means to address an actor. The actor style can be simulated in Go by maintaining a one-to-one correspondence between goroutines and channels, but the language allows multiple goroutines to share a channel or a single goroutine to send and receive on multiple channels.<sup class=\\"reference nowrap\\"><span title=\\"Page / location: 147\\">:\u200a147\u200a</span></sup>\\n</p><p>From these tools one can build concurrent constructs like worker pools, pipelines (in which, say, a file is decompressed and parsed as it downloads), background calls with timeout, \\"fan-out\\" parallel calls to a set of services, and others. Channels have also found uses further from the usual notion of interprocess communication, like serving as a concurrency-safe list of recycled buffers, implementing coroutines (which helped inspire the name <i>goroutine</i>), and implementing iterators.\\n</p><p>Concurrency-related structural conventions of Go (channels and alternative channel inputs) are derived from Tony Hoare\'s communicating sequential processes model. Unlike previous concurrent programming languages such as Occam or Limbo (a language on which Go co-designer Rob Pike worked), Go does not provide any built-in notion of safe or verifiable concurrency. While the communicating-processes model is favored in Go, it is not the only one: all goroutines in a program share a single address space. This means that mutable objects and pointers can be shared between goroutines; see \xa7\xa0Lack of data race safety, below.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Although Go\'s concurrency features are not aimed primarily at parallel processing, they can be used to program shared-memory multi-processor machines. Various studies have been done into the effectiveness of this approach. One of these studies compared the size (in lines of code) and speed of programs written by a seasoned programmer not familiar with the language and corrections to these programs by a Go expert (from Google\'s development team), doing the same for Chapel, Cilk and Intel TBB. The study found that the non-expert tended to write divide-and-conquer algorithms with one <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>go</span> statement per recursion, while the expert wrote distribute-work-synchronize programs using one goroutine per processor core. The expert\'s programs were usually faster, but also longer.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Go\'s approach to concurrency can be summarized as \\"don\'t communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating\\". There are no restrictions on how goroutines access shared data, making data races possible. Specifically, unless a program explicitly synchronizes via channels or other means, writes from one goroutine might be partly, entirely, or not at all visible to another, often with no guarantees about ordering of writes. Furthermore, Go\'s <i>internal data structures</i> like interface values, slice headers, hash tables, and string headers are not immune to data races, so type and memory safety can be violated in multithreaded programs that modify shared instances of those types without synchronization. Instead of language support, safe concurrent programming thus relies on conventions; for example, Chisnall recommends an idiom called \\"aliases xor mutable\\", meaning that passing a mutable value (or pointer) over a channel signals a transfer of ownership over the value to its receiver.<sup class=\\"reference nowrap\\"><span title=\\"Page / location: 155\\">:\u200a155\u200a</span></sup> The gc toolchain has an optional data race detector that can check for unsynchronized access to shared memory during runtime since version 1.1, additionally a best-effort race detector is also included by default since version 1.6 of the gc runtime for access to the <code>map</code> data type.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The linker in the gc toolchain creates statically linked binaries by default; therefore all Go binaries include the Go runtime.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Go deliberately omits certain features common in other languages, including (implementation)\xa0inheritance, assertions, pointer arithmetic, implicit type conversions, untagged unions, and tagged unions. The designers added only those facilities that all three agreed on.\\n</p><p>Of the omitted language features, the designers explicitly argue against assertions and pointer arithmetic, while defending the choice to omit type inheritance as giving a more useful language, encouraging instead the use of interfaces to achieve dynamic dispatch and composition to reuse code. Composition and delegation are in fact largely automated by <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>struct</span> embedding; according to researchers Schmager <i>et al.</i>, this feature \\"has many of the drawbacks of inheritance: it affects the public interface of objects, it is not fine-grained (i.e, no method-level control over embedding), methods of embedded objects cannot be hidden, and it is static\\", making it \\"not obvious\\" whether programmers will overuse it to the extent that programmers in other languages are reputed to overuse inheritance.\\n</p><p>Exception handling was initially omitted in Go due to lack of a \\"design that gives value proportionate to the complexity\\".

In the 11 months since our release, there has been minimal confusion of the two languages.\\"</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Fat pointer</li>\\n<li>Comparison of programming languages</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1217336898\\">\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><span><span>Official website</span></span> <span typeof=\\"mw:File/Frameless\\"></span></li></ul>","image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Go_Logo_Blue.svg/512px-Go_Logo_Blue.svg.png","repositories":[{"name_with_owner":"golang/go","url":"https://github.com/golang/go","description":"The Go programming language","homepage_url":"https://go.dev","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4314092?s=80&v=4","num_forks":17400,"num_issues":841,"num_pull_requests":498,"num_stars":121444,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":100,"color":"fbca04"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Shell","Go","C","HTML","JavaScript","Assembly","Makefile","Awk","Perl","Python"]},{"name_with_owner":"kubernetes/kubernetes","url":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes","description":"Production-Grade Container Scheduling and Management","homepage_url":"https://kubernetes.io","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13629408?s=80&v=4","num_forks":38968,"num_issues":138,"num_pull_requests":696,"num_stars":108636,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":99,"color":"006b75"},{"name":"good first issue","count":10,"color":"7057ff"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Python","Makefile","Shell","C","Go","HTML","sed","Dockerfile","PowerShell","Batchfile"]},{"name_with_owner":"prometheus/prometheus","url":"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus","description":"The Prometheus monitoring system and time series database.","homepage_url":"https://prometheus.io/","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3380462?s=80&v=4","num_forks":8936,"num_issues":89,"num_pull_requests":211,"num_stars":53929,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":88,"color":"006b75"},{"name":"good first issue","count":2,"color":"751B8B"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Makefile","Go","HTML","CSS","JavaScript","Shell","Lex","Dockerfile","TypeScript","Yacc"]},{"name_with_owner":"jesseduffield/lazygit","url":"https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit","description":"simple terminal UI for git commands","homepage_url":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8456633?s=80&u=1183e9d1442669992861877a4f313b51e3bbd119&v=4","num_forks":1739,"num_issues":21,"num_pull_requests":53,"num_stars":48637,"labels":[{"name":"good first issue","count":21,"color":"7057ff"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Go","Shell","Dockerfile","Makefile"]},{"name_with_owner":"etcd-io/etcd","url":"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd","description":"Distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system","homepage_url":"https://etcd.io","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41972792?s=80&v=4","num_forks":9657,"num_issues":58,"num_pull_requests":95,"num_stars":46907,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":58,"color":"d3f49c"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Shell","Go","Makefile","Dockerfile","Jsonnet","Procfile"]},{"name_with_owner":"ethereum/go-ethereum","url":"https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum","description":"Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol","homepage_url":"https://geth.ethereum.org","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6250754?s=80&v=4","num_forks":19756,"num_issues":10,"num_pull_requests":100,"num_stars":46806,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":8,"color":"0e8a16"},{"name":"good first issue","count":3,"color":"006b75"},{"name":"up-for-grabs","count":1,"color":"0e8a16"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Go","Java","Shell","C","Makefile","M4","JavaScript","Assembly","NSIS","HTML"]},{"name_with_owner":"rclone/rclone","url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone","description":"\\"rsync for cloud storage\\" - Google Drive, S3, Dropbox, Backblaze B2, One Drive, Swift, Hubic, Wasabi, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob, Azure Files, Yandex Files","homepage_url":"https://rclone.org","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24937341?s=80&v=4","num_forks":4049,"num_issues":202,"num_pull_requests":133,"num_stars":45238,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":98,"color":"c2e0c6"},{"name":"good first issue","count":9,"color":"5319e7"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Makefile","Shell","Go","Python","HTML","Batchfile","Dockerfile","JavaScript","C","PHP"]},{"name_with_owner":"pingcap/tidb","url":"https://github.com/pingcap/tidb","description":"TiDB is an open-source, cloud-native, distributed, MySQL-Compatible database for elastic scale and real-time analytics.

Designed for teaching, research, and industrial applications, Haskell has pioneered a number of programming language features such as type classes, which enable type-safe operator overloading, and monadic input/output (IO). It is named after logician Haskell Curry. Haskell\'s main implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC).\\n</p><p>Haskell\'s semantics are historically based on those of the Miranda programming language, which served to focus the efforts of the initial Haskell working group. The last formal specification of the language was made in July 2010, while the development of GHC continues to expand Haskell via language extensions.\\n</p><p>Haskell is used in academia and industry. As of May\xa02021, Haskell was the 28th most popular programming language by Google searches for tutorials,  and made up less than 1% of active users on the GitHub source code repository.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After the release of Miranda by Research Software Ltd. in 1985, interest in lazy functional languages grew. By 1987, more than a dozen non-strict, purely functional programming languages existed. Miranda was the most widely used, but it was proprietary software. At the conference on Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture (FPCA \'87) in Portland, Oregon, there was a strong consensus that a committee be formed to define an open standard for such languages. The committee\'s purpose was to consolidate existing functional languages into a common one to serve as a basis for future research in functional-language design.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Haskell was developed by a committee, attempting to bring together off the shelf solutions where possible.\\n</p><p>Type classes, which enable type-safe operator overloading, were first proposed by Philip Wadler and Stephen Blott to address the ad-hoc handling of equality types and arithmetic overloading in languages at the time.\\n</p><p>In early versions of Haskell up until and including version 1.2, user interaction and IO (input and output) were handled by both streams based and continuation based mechanisms which were widely considered unsatisfactory. In version 1.3, monadic IO was introduced, along with the generalisation of type classes to higher kinds (type constructors). Along with \\"do notation\\", which provides syntactic sugar for the Monad type class, this gave Haskell an effect system that maintained referential transparency and was convenient.\\n</p><p>Other notable changes in early versions were the approach to the \'seq\' function, which creates a data dependency between values, and is used in lazy languages to avoid excessive memory consumption; with it moving from a type class to a standard function to make refactoring more practical.\\n</p><p>The first version of Haskell (\\"Haskell 1.0\\") was defined in 1990. The committee\'s efforts resulted in a series of language definitions (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4).\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>In late 1997, the series culminated in <i>Haskell 98</i>, intended to specify a stable, minimal, portable version of the language and an accompanying standard library for teaching, and as a base for future extensions. The committee expressly welcomed creating extensions and variants of Haskell 98 via adding and incorporating experimental features.\\n</p><p>In February 1999, the Haskell 98 language standard was originally published as <i>The Haskell 98 Report</i>. In January 2003, a revised version was published as <i>Haskell 98 Language and Libraries: The Revised Report</i>. The language continues to evolve rapidly, with the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) implementation representing the current <i>de facto</i> standard.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In early 2006, the process of defining a successor to the Haskell 98 standard, informally named <i>Haskell Prime</i>, began. This was intended to be an ongoing incremental process to revise the language definition, producing a new revision up to once per year. The first revision, named <b>Haskell 2010</b>, was announced in November 2009 and published in July 2010.\\n</p><p>Haskell 2010 is an incremental update to the language, mostly incorporating several well-used and uncontroversial features previously enabled via compiler-specific flags.\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>Hierarchical module names. Module names are allowed to consist of dot-separated sequences of capitalized identifiers, rather than only one such identifier. This lets modules be named in a hierarchical manner (e.g., <code>Data.List</code> instead of <code>List</code>), although technically modules are still in a single monolithic namespace. This extension was specified in an addendum to Haskell 98 and was in practice universally used.</li>\\n<li>The foreign function interface (FFI) allows bindings to other programming languages. Only bindings to C are specified in the Report, but the design allows for other language bindings. To support this, data type declarations were permitted to contain no constructors, enabling robust nonce types for foreign data that could not be constructed in Haskell. This extension was also previously specified in an Addendum to the Haskell 98 Report and widely used.</li>\\n<li>So-called <i>n</i>+<i>k</i> patterns (definitions of the form <code>fact (n+1) = (n+1) * fact n</code>) were no longer allowed. This syntactic sugar had misleading semantics, in which the code looked like it used the <code>(+)</code> operator, but in fact desugared to code using <code>(-)</code> and <code>(&gt;=)</code>.</li>\\n<li>The rules of type inference were relaxed to allow more programs to type check.</li>\\n<li>Some syntax issues (changes in the formal grammar) were fixed: pattern guards were added, allowing pattern matching within guards; resolution of operator fixity was specified in a simpler way that reflected actual practice; an edge case in the interaction of the language\'s lexical syntax of operators and comments was addressed, and the interaction of do-notation and if-then-else was tweaked to eliminate unexpected syntax errors.</li>\\n<li>The <code>LANGUAGE</code> pragma was specified. By 2010, dozens of extensions to the language were in wide use, and GHC (among other compilers) provided the <code>LANGUAGE</code> pragma to specify individual extensions with a list of identifiers. Haskell 2010 compilers are required to support the <code>Haskell2010</code> extension and are encouraged to support several others, which correspond to extensions added in Haskell 2010.</li></ul>\\n\\n<p>The next formal specification had been planned for 2020. On 29 October 2021, with GHC version 9.2.1, the GHC2021 extension was released. While this is not a formal language spec, it combines a number of stable, widely-used GHC extensions to Haskell 2010.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>Haskell features lazy evaluation, lambda expressions, pattern matching, list comprehension, type classes and type polymorphism. It is a purely functional language, which means that functions generally have no side effects. A distinct construct exists to represent side effects, orthogonal to the type of functions. A pure function can return a side effect that is subsequently executed, modeling the impure functions of other languages.\\n</p><p>Haskell has a strong, static type system based on Hindley\u2013Milner type inference. Its principal innovation in this area is type classes, originally conceived as a principled way to add overloading to the language, but since finding many more uses.\\n</p><p>The construct that represents side-effects is an example of a monad: a general framework which can model various computations such as error handling, nondeterminism, parsing and software transactional memory.

In particular it disables type classes by default.\\n</p><p>Ben Lippmeier designed Disciple as a strict-by-default (lazy by explicit annotation) dialect of Haskell with a type-and-effect system, to address Haskell\'s difficulties in reasoning about lazy evaluation and in using traditional data structures such as mutable arrays. He argues (p.\xa020) that \\"destructive update furnishes the programmer with two important and powerful tools\xa0... a set of efficient array-like data structures for managing collections of objects, and ... the ability to broadcast a new value to all parts of a program with minimal burden on the programmer.\\"\\n</p><p>Robert Harper, one of the authors of Standard ML, has given his reasons for not using Haskell to teach introductory programming. Among these are the difficulty of reasoning about resource use with non-strict evaluation, that lazy evaluation complicates the definition of datatypes and inductive reasoning, and the \\"inferiority\\" of Haskell\'s (old) class system compared to ML\'s module system.\\n</p><p>Haskell\'s build tool, Cabal, has historically been criticized for poorly handling multiple versions of the same library, a problem known as \\"Cabal hell\\". The Stackage server and Stack build tool were made in response to these criticisms. Cabal itself now has a much more sophisticated build system, heavily inspired by Nix, which became the default with version 3.0.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Clean is a close, slightly older relative of Haskell.

high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers <i>write once, run anywhere</i> (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. \\n</p><p>Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming language since then. Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub. Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity.\\n</p><p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun\'s Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.\\n</p><p>As of March\xa02024, Java 22 is the latest version. Java 8, 11, 17, and 21 are previous LTS versions still officially supported.\\n</p>","image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg/234px-Java_programming_language_logo.svg.png","repositories":[{"name_with_owner":"elastic/elasticsearch","url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch","description":"Free and Open, Distributed, RESTful Search Engine","homepage_url":"https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6764390?s=80&v=4","num_forks":24395,"num_issues":120,"num_pull_requests":713,"num_stars":68695,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":85,"color":"207de5"},{"name":"good first issue","count":21,"color":"07569b"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Shell","Python","Java","HTML","Groovy","Batchfile","Emacs Lisp","FreeMarker","ANTLR","Dockerfile"]},{"name_with_owner":"apache/dubbo","url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.\\n</p><p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).\\n</p><p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.\\n</p><p>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.\\n</p><p>During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.\\n</p><p>The goal was a \\"language for the masses\\", \\"to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites\\". Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages. Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.\\n</p><p>The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft created its own interpreter called JScript.\\n</p><p>Microsoft first released JScript in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Netscape Navigator. These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of \\"best viewed in Netscape\\" and \\"best viewed in Internet Explorer\\" logos for several years.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.\\n</p><p>The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.\\n</p><p>However, the effort to fully standardize the language was undermined by Microsoft gaining an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer\'s market share reached 95%. This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.\\n</p><p>Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on ECMA work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.\\n</p><p>In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.\\n</p><p>Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open-source communities not affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open-source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools.\\n</p><p>Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster than its competition. The key innovation was just-in-time compilation (JIT), so other browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines for JIT.\\n</p><p>In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.\\n</p><p>The creation of Node.js in 2009 by Ryan Dahl sparked a significant increase in the usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Node combines the V8 engine, an event loop, and I/O APIs, thereby providing a stand-alone JavaScript runtime system. As of 2018, Node had been used by millions of developers, and npm had the most modules of any package manager in the world.\\n</p><p>The ECMAScript draft specification is currently maintained openly on GitHub, and editions are produced via regular annual snapshots. Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive proposal process. Now, instead of edition numbers, developers check the status of upcoming features individually.\\n</p><p>The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks, established programming practices, and substantial usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page applications and other JavaScript-heavy websites, several transpilers have been created to aid the development process.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\"JavaScript\\" is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States. The trademark was originally issued to Sun Microsystems on 6 May 1997, and was transferred to Oracle when they acquired Sun in 2009.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose. Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM. \\n</p><p>All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user\'s device.\\n</p>\\n\\n<ul><li>Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.</li>\\n<li>Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.</li>\\n<li>Playing browser games.</li>\\n<li>Controlling the playback of streaming media.</li>\\n<li>Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.</li>\\n<li>Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.</li>\\n<li>Logging data about the user\'s behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.</li>\\n<li>Redirecting a user to another page.</li>\\n<li>Storing and retrieving data on the user\'s device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards.</li></ul>\\n\\n<p>Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework as part of their client-side scripting.\\n</p><p>jQuery is by far the most-used. Other notable ones include Angular, Bootstrap, Lodash, Modernizr, React, Underscore, and Vue. Multiple options can be used in conjunction, such as jQuery and Bootstrap.\\n</p><p>However, the term \\"Vanilla JS\\" was coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.\\n</p><p>Initial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft\'s Internet Information Services, but they were small niches. Server-side usage eventually started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches.\\n</p><p>Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.\\n</p><p>JavaScript has recently begun to appear in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A JavaScript engine must be embedded within a runtime system (such as a web browser or a standalone system) to enable scripts to interact with the broader environment. The runtime system includes the necessary APIs for input/output operations, such as networking, storage, and graphics, and provides the ability to import scripts.\\n</p><p>JavaScript is a single-threaded language. The runtime processes messages from a queue one at a time, and it calls a function associated with each new message, creating a call stack frame with the function\'s arguments and local variables. The call stack shrinks and grows based on the function\'s needs. When the call stack is empty upon function completion, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the event loop, described as \\"run to completion\\" because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language\'s concurrency model describes the event loop as non-blocking: program I/O is performed using events and callback functions. This means, for example, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information.\\n</p><p>The notable standalone runtimes are Node.js, Deno, and Bun.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations unless explicitly specified otherwise.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., <code>if</code> statements, <code>while</code> loops, <code>switch</code> statements, <code>do while</code> loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with <code>var</code>; block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>The binary <code>+</code> operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. This is because the addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator</li>\\n<li>The binary <code>-</code> operator always casts both operands to a number</li>\\n<li>Both unary operators (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>) always cast the operand to a number</li></ul>\\n<p>Values are cast to strings like the following:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>Strings are left as-is</li>\\n<li>Numbers are converted to their string representation</li>\\n<li>Arrays have their elements cast to strings after which they are joined by commas (<code>,</code>)</li>\\n<li>Other objects are converted to the string <code>[object Object]</code> where <code>Object</code> is the name of the constructor of the object</li></ul>\\n<p>Values are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the strings to numbers. These processes can be modified by defining <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code> functions on the prototype for string and number casting respectively.\\n</p><p>JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules can be mistaken for inconsistency. For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Often also mentioned is <code>{} + []</code> resulting in <code>0</code> (number). This is misleading: the <code>{}</code> is interpreted as an empty code block instead of an empty object, and the empty array is cast to a number by the remaining unary <code>+</code> operator. If the expression is wrapped in parentheses - <code>({} + [])</code> - the curly brackets are interpreted as an empty object and the result of the expression is <code>\\"[object Object]\\"</code> as expected.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>JavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value rather than an expression. For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a string. JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>JavaScript includes an <code>eval</code> function that can execute statements provided as strings at run-time.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\"templatequote\\"><p>You make prototype objects, and then ... make new instances. Objects are mutable in JavaScript, so we can augment the new instances, giving them new fields and methods. These can then act as prototypes for even newer objects. We don\'t need classes to make lots of similar objects... Objects inherit from objects. What could be more object oriented than that?\\n</p></blockquote>\\n<p>In JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype (see below); each key provides the name for an object property, and there are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation (<code>obj.x\xa0=\xa010</code>) and bracket notation (<code>obj[\'x\']\xa0=\xa010</code>). A property may be added, rebound, or deleted at run-time. Most properties of an object (and any property that belongs to an object\'s prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a <code>for...in</code> loop.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>JavaScript uses prototypes where many other object-oriented languages use classes for inheritance. It is possible to simulate many class-based features with prototypes in JavaScript.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Functions double as object constructors, along with their typical role. Prefixing a function call with <i>new</i> will create an instance of a prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor (including properties from the <code>Object</code> prototype). ECMAScript 5 offers the <code>Object.create</code> method, allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the <code>Object</code> prototype (older environments can assign the prototype to <code>null</code>). The constructor\'s <code>prototype</code> property determines the object used for the new object\'s internal prototype. New methods can be added by modifying the prototype of the function used as a constructor. JavaScript\'s built-in constructors, such as <code>Array</code> or <code>Object</code>, also have prototypes that can be modified. While it is possible to modify the <code>Object</code> prototype, it is generally considered bad practice because most objects in JavaScript will inherit methods and properties from the <code>Object</code> prototype, and they may not expect the prototype to be modified.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>Unlike in many object-oriented languages, in JavaScript there is no distinction between a function definition and a method definition. Rather, the distinction occurs during function calling. When a function is called as a method of an object, the function\'s local <i>this</i> keyword is bound to that object for that invocation.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>JavaScript functions are first-class; a function is considered to be an object. As such, a function may have properties and methods, such as <code>.call()</code> and <code>.bind()</code>. \\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>A <i>nested</i> function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked. \\n</p><p>In addition, each nested function forms a lexical closure: the lexical scope of the outer function (including any constant, local variable, or argument value) becomes part of the internal state of each inner function object, even after execution of the outer function concludes. \\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>JavaScript also supports anonymous functions.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>JavaScript supports implicit and explicit delegation.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>JavaScript natively supports various function-based implementations of Role patterns like Traits and Mixins. Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one method bound to the <code>this</code> keyword within its <code>function</code> body. A Role then has to be delegated explicitly via <code>call</code> or <code>apply</code> to objects that need to feature additional behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Whereas explicit function-based delegation does cover composition in JavaScript, implicit delegation already happens every time the prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that might be related to but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it gets called within this object\'s context. Thus inheritance in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>JavaScript is a zero-index language.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>An indefinite number of parameters can be passed to a function. The function can access them through formal parameters and also through the local <code>arguments</code> object. Variadic functions can also be created by using the <code>bind</code> method.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>Like in many scripting languages, arrays and objects (associative arrays in other languages) can each be created with a succinct shortcut syntax. In fact, these literals form the basis of the JSON data format.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>In a manner similar to Perl, JavaScript also supports regular expressions, which provide a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>JavaScript supports promises and Async/await for handling asynchronous operations. \\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>A built-in Promise object provides functionality for handling promises and associating handlers with an asynchronous action\'s eventual result. Recently, the JavaScript specification introduced combinator methods, which allow developers to combine multiple JavaScript promises and do operations based on different scenarios. The methods introduced are: Promise.race, Promise.all, Promise.allSettled and Promise.any.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>Async/await allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a way similar to an ordinary synchronous function. Asynchronous, non-blocking code can be written, with minimal overhead, structured similarly to traditional synchronous, blocking code.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Historically, some JavaScript engines supported these non-standard features:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>conditional <code>catch</code> clauses (like Java)</li>\\n<li>array comprehensions and generator expressions (like Python)</li>\\n<li>concise function expressions (<code>function(args) expr</code>; this experimental syntax predated arrow functions)</li>\\n<li>ECMAScript for XML (E4X), an extension that adds native XML support to ECMAScript (unsupported in Firefox since version 21)</li></ul>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n\\n<p>Variables in JavaScript can be defined using either the <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> keywords.  Variables defined without keywords will be defined at the global scope.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Note the comments in the examples above, all of which were preceded with two forward slashes.\\n</p><p>There is no built-in Input/output functionality in JavaScript, instead it is provided by the run-time environment. The ECMAScript specification in edition 5.1 mentions that \\"there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results\\".\\nHowever, most runtime environments have a <code>console</code> object that can be used to print output. Here is a minimalist \\"Hello, World!\\" program in JavaScript in a runtime environment with a console object:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In HTML documents, a program like this is required for an output:\\n</p>\\n<p>A simple recursive function to calculate the factorial of a natural number:\\n</p>\\n<p>An anonymous function (or lambda):\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>This example shows that, in JavaScript, function closures capture their non-local variables by reference.\\n</p><p>Arrow functions were first introduced in 6th Edition - ECMAScript 2015. They shorten the syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. Arrow functions are anonymous, so a variable is needed to refer to them in order to invoke them after their creation, unless surrounded by parenthesis and executed immediately.\\n</p><p>Example of arrow function:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In JavaScript, objects can be created as instances of a class.\\n</p><p>Object class example:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In JavaScript, objects can be instantiated directly from a function.\\n</p><p>Object functional example:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Variadic function demonstration (<code>arguments</code> is a special variable):\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Immediately-invoked function expressions are often used to create closures.

Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one website do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.\\n</p><p>There are subsets of general JavaScript\u2014ADsafe, Secure ECMAScript (SES)\u2014that provide greater levels of security, especially on code created by third parties (such as advertisements). Closure Toolkit is another project for safe embedding and isolation of third-party JavaScript and HTML.\\n</p><p>Content Security Policy is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a Web page.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>A common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (XSS), a violation of the same-origin policy. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can cause a target Website, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim\'s authorization. One important solution to XSS vulnerabilities is HTML sanitization.\\n</p><p>Some browsers include partial protection against <i>reflected</i> XSS attacks, in which the attacker provides a URL including malicious script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other XSS attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a database. Only correct design of Web applications on the server-side can fully prevent XSS.\\n</p><p>XSS vulnerabilities can also occur because of implementation mistakes by browser authors.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>Another cross-site vulnerability is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker\'s site tricks the victim\'s browser into taking actions the user did not intend at a target site (like transferring money at a bank). When target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker\'s site can carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.\\n</p><p>\\"JavaScript hijacking\\" is a type of CSRF attack in which a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag on an attacker\'s site exploits a page on the victim\'s site that returns private information such as JSON or JavaScript. Possible solutions include:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>requiring an authentication token in the POST and GET parameters for any response that returns private information.</li></ul>\\n\\n<p>Developers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers. The application author cannot assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary. Some implications are:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>Website authors cannot perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates because the raw source code must be sent to the client. The code can be obfuscated, but obfuscation can be reverse-engineered.</li>\\n<li>JavaScript form validation only provides convenience for users, not security. If a site verifies that the user agreed to its terms of service, or filters invalid characters out of fields that should only contain numbers, it must do so on the server, not only the client.</li>\\n<li>Scripts can be selectively disabled, so JavaScript cannot be relied on to prevent operations such as right-clicking on an image to save it.</li>\\n<li>It is considered very bad practice to embed sensitive information such as passwords in JavaScript because it can be extracted by an attacker.</li>\\n<li>Prototype pollution is a runtime vulnerability in which attackers can overwrite arbitrary properties in an object\'s prototype.</li></ul>\\n\\n<p>Package management systems such as npm and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers. Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program\'s dependencies upon other developers\' program libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date, but that is not always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied-upon libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. In a study done looking over a sample of 133,000 websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at least one known vulnerability. \\"The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago.\\" Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Ko\xe7ulu removed his repository from npm. This caused tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>JavaScript provides an interface to a wide range of browser capabilities, some of which may have flaws such as buffer overflows. These flaws can allow attackers to write scripts that would run any code they wish on the user\'s system. This code is not by any means limited to another JavaScript application. For example, a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attacker to gain access to the operating system\'s API with superuser privileges.\\n</p><p>These flaws have affected major browsers including Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.\\n</p><p>Plugins, such as video players, Adobe Flash, and the wide range of ActiveX controls enabled by default in Microsoft Internet Explorer, may also have flaws exploitable via JavaScript (such flaws have been exploited in the past).\\n</p><p>In Windows Vista, Microsoft has attempted to contain the risks of bugs such as buffer overflows by running the Internet Explorer process with limited privileges. Google Chrome similarly confines its page renderers to their own \\"sandbox\\".\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Web browsers are capable of running JavaScript outside the sandbox, with the privileges necessary to, for example, create or delete files. Such privileges are not intended to be granted to code from the Web.\\n</p><p>Incorrectly granting privileges to JavaScript from the Web has played a role in vulnerabilities in both Internet Explorer and Firefox. In Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft demoted JScript\'s privileges in Internet Explorer.\\n</p><p>Microsoft Windows allows JavaScript source files on a computer\'s hard drive to be launched as general-purpose, non-sandboxed programs (see: Windows Script Host). This makes JavaScript (like VBScript) a theoretically viable vector for a Trojan horse, although JavaScript Trojan horses are uncommon in practice.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In 2015, a JavaScript-based proof-of-concept implementation of a rowhammer attack was described in a paper by security researchers.\\n</p><p>In 2017, a JavaScript-based attack via browser was demonstrated that could bypass ASLR. It is called \\"ASLR\u2295Cache\\" or AnC.\\n</p><p>In 2018, the paper that announced the Spectre attacks against Speculative Execution in Intel and other processors included a JavaScript implementation.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Important tools have evolved with the language.\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>Every major web browser has built-in web development tools, including a JavaScript debugger.</li>\\n<li>Static program analysis tools, such as ESLint and JSLint, scan JavaScript code for conformance to a set of standards and guidelines.</li>\\n<li>Some browsers have built-in profilers. Stand-alone profiling libraries have also been created, such as benchmark.js and jsbench.</li>\\n<li>Many text editors have syntax highlighting support for JavaScript code.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n<p>A common misconception is that JavaScript is directly related to Java. Both indeed have a C-like syntax (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language). They are also typically sandboxed, and JavaScript was designed with Java\'s syntax and standard library in mind. In particular, all Java keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript\'s standard library follows Java\'s naming conventions, and JavaScript\'s <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-javascript mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>Math</span></code> and <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-javascript mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>Date</span></code> objects are based on classes from Java 1.0.\\n</p><p>Both languages first appeared in 1995, but Java was developed by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems and JavaScript by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications.\\n</p><p>The differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has static typing, while JavaScript\'s typing is dynamic. Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human-readable source code. Java\'s objects are class-based, while JavaScript\'s are prototype-based. Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has done so from the beginning, being influenced by Scheme.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>JSON is a data format derived from JavaScript; hence the name JavaScript Object Notation. It is a widely-used format supported by many other programming languages.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Many websites are JavaScript-heavy, so transpilers have been created to convert code written in other languages, which can aid the development process.\\n</p><p>TypeScript and CoffeeScript are two notable languages that transpile to JavaScript.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>WebAssembly is a newer language with a bytecode format designed to complement JavaScript, especially the performance-critical portions of web page scripts. All of the major JavaScript engines support WebAssembly, which runs in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.\\n</p><p>asm.js is a subset of JavaScript that served as the forerunner of WebAssembly.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1215172403\\"><cite id=\\"CITEREFDere2017\\" class=\\"citation news cs1\\">Dere, Mohan (21 December 2017). \\"How to integrate create-react-app with all the libraries you need to make a great app\\". <i>freeCodeCamp</i><span>.

Distinctive aspects of Julia\'s design include a type system with parametric polymorphism and the use of multiple dispatch as a core programming paradigm, efficient garbage collection, and a just-in-time (JIT) compiler (with support for ahead-of-time compilation).\\n</p><p>Julia can be run similar to (interpreted) scripting languages (i.e. Julia has a REPL), and does by default using its runtime (when preinstalled), but Julia programs/source code can also optionally be sent to users in one ready-to-install/run file, which can be made quickly, not needing anything preinstalled. Julia programs can also be (separately) compiled to binary executables, even allowing no-source-code distribution. Such compilation is not needed for speed, since Julia is also compiled when running interactively, but it can help with hiding source code.

Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin\'s standard library depends on the Java Class Library,\\nbut type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React) or native code via LLVM (e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps). Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.\\n</p><p>On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language was now its preferred language for Android app developers. Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler. The Android Kotlin compiler produces Java 8 bytecode by default (which runs in any later JVM), but lets the programmer choose to target Java 9 up to 20, for optimization, or allows for more features; has bidirectional record class interoperability support for JVM, introduced in Java 16, considered stable as of Kotlin 1.5.\\n</p><p>Kotlin has support for the web with Kotlin/JS, either through a classic interpreter-based backend which has been declared stable since version 1.3, or an intermediate representation-based backend which has been declared stable since version 1.8. Kotlin/Native (for e.g. Apple silicon support) is considered beta since version 1.3.\\n</p>","image_url":"","repositories":[{"name_with_owner":"coil-kt/coil","url":"https://github.com/coil-kt/coil","description":"Image loading for Android and Compose

MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.\\n</p><p>Although MATLAB is intended primarily for numeric computing, an optional toolbox uses the MuPAD symbolic engine allowing access to symbolic computing abilities. An additional package, Simulink, adds graphical multi-domain simulation and model-based design for dynamic and embedded systems.\\n</p><p>As of 2020, MATLAB has more than four million users worldwide. They come from various backgrounds of engineering, science, and economics. As of 2017, more than 5000 global colleges and universities use MATLAB to support instruction and research.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>MATLAB was invented by mathematician and computer programmer Cleve Moler. The idea for MATLAB was based on his 1960s PhD thesis. Moler became a math professor at the University of New Mexico and started developing MATLAB for his students as a hobby. He developed MATLAB\'s initial linear algebra programming in 1967 with his one-time thesis advisor, George Forsythe. This was followed by Fortran code for linear equations in 1971.\\n</p><p>Before version 1.0, MATLAB \\"was not a programming language; it was a simple interactive matrix calculator. There were no programs, no toolboxes, no graphics. And no ODEs or FFTs.\\"\\n</p><p>The first early version of MATLAB was completed in the late 1970s. The software was disclosed to the public for the first time in February 1979 at the Naval Postgraduate School in California. Early versions of MATLAB were simple matrix calculators with 71 pre-built functions. At the time, MATLAB was distributed for free to universities. Moler would leave copies at universities he visited and the software developed a strong following in the math departments of university campuses.<sup class=\\"reference nowrap\\"><span title=\\"Page / location: 5\\">:\u200a5\u200a</span></sup>\\n</p><p>In the 1980s, Cleve Moler met John N. Little. They decided to reprogram MATLAB in C and market it for the IBM desktops that were replacing mainframe computers at the time. John Little and programmer Steve Bangert re-programmed MATLAB in C, created the MATLAB programming language, and developed features for toolboxes.\\n</p><p>Since 1993 an open source alternative, GNU Octave (mostly compatible with matlab) and scilab (similar to matlab) have been available.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>MATLAB was first released as a commercial product in 1984 at the Automatic Control Conference in Las Vegas. MathWorks, Inc. was founded to develop the software and the MATLAB programming language was released. The first MATLAB sale was the following year, when Nick Trefethen from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology bought ten copies. \\n</p><p>By the end of the 1980s, several hundred copies of MATLAB had been sold to universities for student use. The software was popularized largely thanks to toolboxes created by experts in various fields for performing specialized mathematical tasks. Many of the toolboxes were developed as a result of Stanford students that used MATLAB in academia, then brought the software with them to the private sector.\\n</p><p>Over time, MATLAB was re-written for early operating systems created by Digital Equipment Corporation, VAX,  Sun Microsystems, and for Unix PCs. Version 3 was released in 1987. The first MATLAB compiler was developed by Stephen C. Johnson in the 1990s.\\n</p><p>In 2000, MathWorks added a Fortran-based library for linear algebra in MATLAB 6, replacing the software\'s original LINPACK and EISPACK subroutines that were in C. MATLAB\'s Parallel Computing Toolbox was released at the 2004 Supercomputing Conference and support for graphics processing units (GPUs) was added to it in 2010.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Some especially large changes to the software were made with version 8 in 2012. The user interface was reworked and Simulink\'s functionality was expanded. By 2016, MATLAB had introduced several technical and user interface improvements, including the MATLAB Live Editor notebook, and other features.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The MATLAB application is built around the MATLAB programming language. Common usage of the MATLAB application involves using the \\"Command Window\\" as an interactive mathematical shell or executing text files containing MATLAB code.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>An example of a \\"Hello, world!\\" program exists in MATLAB.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>It displays like so:\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Variables are defined using the assignment operator, <code>=</code>. MATLAB is a weakly typed programming language because types are implicitly converted.  It is an inferred typed language because variables can be assigned without declaring their type, except if they are to be treated as symbolic objects, and that their type can change. Values can come from constants, from computation involving values of other variables, or from the output of a function. For example:\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>A simple array is defined using the colon syntax: <i>initial</i><code>:</code><i>increment</i><code>:</code><i>terminator</i>. For instance:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>defines a variable named <code>array</code> (or assigns a new value to an existing variable with the name <code>array</code>) which is an array consisting of the values 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. That is, the array starts at 1 (the <i>initial</i> value), increments with each step from the previous value by 2 (the <i>increment</i> value), and stops once it reaches (or is about to exceed) 9 (the <i>terminator</i> value).\\n</p><p>The <i>increment</i> value can actually be left out of this syntax (along with one of the colons), to use a default value of 1.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>assigns to the variable named <code>ari</code> an array with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, since the default value of 1 is used as the increment.\\n</p><p>Indexing is one-based, which is the usual convention for matrices in mathematics, unlike zero-based indexing commonly used in other programming languages such as C, C++, and Java.\\n</p><p>Matrices can be defined by separating the elements of a row with blank space or comma and using a semicolon to separate the rows. The list of elements should be surrounded by square brackets <code>[]</code>. Parentheses <code>()</code> are used to access elements and subarrays (they are also used to denote a function argument list).\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Sets of indices can be specified by expressions such as <code>2:4</code>, which evaluates to <code>[2, 3, 4]</code>.  For example, a submatrix taken from rows 2 through 4 and columns 3 through 4 can be written as:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>A square identity matrix of size <i>n</i> can be generated using the function <code>eye</code>, and matrices of any size with zeros or ones can be generated with the functions <code>zeros</code> and <code>ones</code>, respectively.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Transposing a vector or a matrix is done either by the function <code>transpose</code> or by adding dot-prime after the matrix (without the dot, prime will perform conjugate transpose for complex arrays):\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Most functions accept arrays as input and operate element-wise on each element. For example, <code>mod(2*J,n)</code> will multiply every element in <i>J</i> by 2, and then reduce each element modulo <i>n</i>. MATLAB does include standard <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops, but (as in other similar applications such as APL and R), using the vectorized notation is encouraged and is often faster to execute. The following code, excerpted from the function <i>magic.m</i>, creates a magic square <i>M</i> for odd values of <i>n</i> (MATLAB function <code>meshgrid</code> is used here to generate square matrices <span>I</span> and <span>J</span> containing <span>\u2060<span><span><math xmlns=\\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\\" alttext=\\"{\\\\displaystyle 1:n}\\">\\n  <semantics>\\n    <mrow class=\\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\\">\\n      <mstyle displaystyle=\\"true\\" scriptlevel=\\"0\\">\\n        <mn>1</mn>\\n        <mo>:</mo>\\n        <mi>n</mi>\\n      </mstyle>\\n    </mrow>\\n    <annotation encoding=\\"application/x-tex\\">{\\\\displaystyle 1:n}</annotation>\\n  </semantics>\\n</math></span></span>\u2060</span>):\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>MATLAB supports structure data types. Since all variables in MATLAB are arrays, a more adequate name is \\"structure array\\", where each element of the array has the same field names. In addition, MATLAB supports dynamic field names (field look-ups by name, field manipulations, etc.).\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>When creating a MATLAB function, the name of the file should match the name of the first function in the file. Valid function names begin with an alphabetic character, and can contain letters, numbers, or underscores.  Variables and functions are case sensitive.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>MATLAB supports elements of lambda calculus by introducing function handles, or function references, which are implemented either in .m files or anonymous/nested functions.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>MATLAB supports object-oriented programming including classes, inheritance, virtual dispatch, packages, pass-by-value semantics, and pass-by-reference semantics. However, the syntax and calling conventions are significantly different from other languages. MATLAB has value classes and reference classes, depending on whether the class has <i>handle</i> as a super-class (for reference classes) or not (for value classes).\\n</p><p>Method call behavior is different between value and reference classes. For example, a call to a method:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>can alter any member of <i>object</i> only if <i>object</i> is an instance of a reference class, otherwise value class methods must return a new instance if it needs to modify the object.\\n</p><p>An example of a simple class is provided below:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>When put into a file named <code>hello.m</code>, this can be executed with the following commands:\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>MATLAB has tightly integrated graph-plotting features. For example, the function <i>plot</i> can be used to produce a graph from two vectors <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. The code:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>produces the following figure of the sine function:\\n</p><p><span typeof=\\"mw:File\\"></span>\\n</p><p>MATLAB supports three-dimensional graphics as well:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>MATLAB supports developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications. UIs can be generated either programmatically or using visual design environments such as <i>GUIDE</i> and <i>App Designer</i>.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>MATLAB can call functions and subroutines written in the programming languages C or Fortran. A wrapper function is created allowing MATLAB data types to be passed and returned. MEX files (MATLAB executables) are the dynamically loadable object files created by compiling such functions. Since 2014 increasing two-way interfacing with Python was being added.\\n</p><p>Libraries written in Perl, Java, ActiveX or .NET can be directly called from MATLAB, and many MATLAB libraries (for example XML or SQL support) are implemented as wrappers around Java or ActiveX libraries. Calling MATLAB from Java is more complicated, but can be done with a MATLAB toolbox which is sold separately by MathWorks, or using an undocumented mechanism called JMI (Java-to-MATLAB  Interface), (which should not be confused with the unrelated Java Metadata Interface that is also called JMI). Official MATLAB API for Java was added in 2016.\\n</p><p>As alternatives to the MuPAD based Symbolic Math Toolbox available from MathWorks, MATLAB can be connected to Maple or Mathematica.\\n</p><p>Libraries also exist to import and export MathML.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In 2020, MATLAB withdrew services from two Chinese universities as a result of US sanctions.  The universities said this will be responded to by increased use of open-source alternatives and by developing domestic alternatives.\\n</p>\\n\\n<ul><li>Comparison of numerical-analysis software</li>\\n<li>List of numerical-analysis software</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><span><span>Official website</span></span></li>\\n<li>MATLAB at Curlie</li></ul>","image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Matlab_Logo.png","repositories":[{"name_with_owner":"MatthewPeterKelly/OptimTraj","url":"https://github.com/MatthewPeterKelly/OptimTraj","description":"A trajectory optimization library for Matlab","homepage_url":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8137529?s=80&u=a33db2681ffeeca6f868944d9bd89a59e6114752&v=4","num_forks":207,"num_issues":12,"num_pull_requests":0,"num_stars":603,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":9,"color":"159818"},{"name":"good first issue","count":3,"color":"1d76db"}],"issues":[],"languages":["MATLAB"]},{"name_with_owner":"CERN/TIGRE","url":"https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE","description":"TIGRE: Tomographic Iterative GPU-based Reconstruction Toolbox","homepage_url":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320945?s=80&v=4","num_forks":180,"num_issues":14,"num_pull_requests":6,"num_stars":540,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":8,"color":"128A0C"},{"name":"good first issue","count":6,"color":"0E8A16"}],"issues":[],"languages":["MATLAB","C++","Cuda","TeX","Python","Shell","Cython","HTML","Rich Text Format"]}]},{"name":"objectivec","summary_html":"<p class=\\"mw-empty-elt\\">\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Objective-C</b> is a high-level general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language.  Originally developed by Brad Cox and Tom Love in the early 1980s, it was selected by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system.  Due to Apple macOS\u2019s direct lineage from NeXTSTEP, Objective-C was the standard programming language used, supported, and promoted by Apple for developing macOS and iOS applications (via their respective APIs, Cocoa and Cocoa Touch) until the introduction of the Swift programming language in 2014.\\n</p><p>Objective-C programs developed for non-Apple operating systems or that are not dependent on Apple\'s APIs may also be compiled for any platform supported by GNU GCC or LLVM/Clang.\\n</p><p>Objective-C source code \'messaging/implementation\' program files usually have <span>.m</span> filename extensions, while Objective-C \'header/interface\' files have <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>.h</span> extensions, the same as C header files. Objective-C++ files are denoted with a <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>.mm</span> file extension.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Objective-C was created primarily by Brad Cox and Tom Love in the early 1980s at their company Productivity Products International (PPI).\\n</p><p>Leading up to the creation of their company, both had been introduced to Smalltalk while at ITT Corporation\'s Programming Technology Center in 1981. The earliest work on Objective-C traces back to around that time. Cox was intrigued by problems of true reusability in software design and programming. He realized that a language like Smalltalk would be invaluable in building development environments for system developers at ITT. However, he and Tom Love also recognized that backward compatibility with C was critically important in ITT\'s telecom engineering milieu.\\n</p><p>Cox began writing a pre-processor for C to add some of the abilities of Smalltalk. He soon had a working implementation of an object-oriented extension to the C language, which he called \\"OOPC\\" for Object-Oriented Pre-Compiler.\\nLove was hired by Schlumberger Research in 1982 and had the opportunity to acquire the first commercial copy of Smalltalk-80, which further influenced the development of their brainchild. In order to demonstrate that real progress could be made, Cox showed that making interchangeable software components really needed only a few practical changes to existing tools. Specifically, they needed to support objects in a flexible manner, come supplied with a usable set of libraries, and allow for the code (and any resources needed by the code) to be bundled into one cross-platform format.\\n</p><p>Love and Cox eventually formed PPI to commercialize their product, which coupled an Objective-C compiler with class libraries. In 1986, Cox published the main description of Objective-C in its original form in the book <i>Object-Oriented Programming, An Evolutionary Approach</i>. Although he was careful to point out that there is more to the problem of reusability than just what Objective-C provides, the language often found itself compared feature for feature with other languages.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In 1988, NeXT licensed Objective-C from StepStone (the new name of PPI, the owner of the Objective-C trademark) and extended the GCC compiler to support Objective-C. NeXT developed the AppKit and Foundation Kit libraries on which the NeXTSTEP user interface and Interface Builder were based. While the NeXT workstations failed to make a great impact in the marketplace, the tools were widely lauded in the industry. NeXT dropped hardware production and focused on software tools, selling NeXTSTEP (and OPENSTEP) as a platform for custom programming.\\n</p><p>In order to circumvent the terms of the GPL, NeXT had originally intended to ship the Objective-C frontend separately, allowing the user to link it with GCC to produce the compiler executable. Though initially accepted by Richard M. Stallman, this plan was rejected after Stallman consulted with GNU\'s lawyers and NeXT agreed to make Objective-C part of GCC.\\n</p><p>The work to extend GCC was led by Steve Naroff, who joined NeXT from StepStone. The compiler changes were made available as per GPL license terms, but the runtime libraries were not, rendering the open source contribution unusable to the general public.  This led to other parties developing such runtime libraries under open source licenses.  Later, Steve Naroff was also principal contributor to work at Apple to build the Objective-C frontend to Clang.\\n</p><p>The GNU project started work on its free software implementation of Cocoa, named GNUstep, based on the OpenStep standard. Dennis Glatting wrote the first GNU Objective-C runtime in 1992. The current GNU Objective-C runtime, in use since 1993, is the one developed by Kresten Krab Thorup while he was a university student in Denmark. Thorup also worked at NeXT from 1993 to 1996.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>After acquiring NeXT in 1996, Apple Computer used OpenStep in its then-new operating system, Mac OS X. This included Objective-C, NeXT\'s Objective-C-based developer tool, Project Builder, and its interface design tool, Interface Builder. Both were later merged into one application, Xcode. Most of Apple\'s current Cocoa API is based on OpenStep interface objects and is the most significant Objective-C environment being used for active development.\\n</p><p>At WWDC 2014, Apple introduced a new language, Swift, which was characterized as \\"Objective-C without the C\\".\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Objective-C is a thin layer atop C and is a \\"strict superset\\" of C, meaning that it is possible to compile any C program with an Objective-C compiler and to freely include C language code within an Objective-C class.\\n</p><p>Objective-C derives its object syntax from Smalltalk. All of the syntax for non-object-oriented operations (including primitive variables, pre-processing, expressions, function declarations, and function calls) are identical to those of C, while the syntax for object-oriented features is an implementation of Smalltalk-style messaging.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The Objective-C model of object-oriented programming is based on message passing to object instances. In Objective-C one does not <i>call a method</i>; one <i>sends a message</i>. This is unlike the Simula-style programming model used by C++. The difference between these two concepts is in how the code referenced by the method or message name is executed. In a Simula-style language, the method name is in most cases bound to a section of code in the target class by the compiler. In Smalltalk and Objective-C, the target of a message is resolved at runtime, with the receiving object itself interpreting the message. A method is identified by a <i>selector</i> or <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>SEL</span> \u2014 a unique identifier for each message name, often just a <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>NUL</span>-terminated string representing its name \u2014 and resolved to a C method pointer implementing it: an <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>IMP</span>. A consequence of this is that the message-passing system has no type checking. The object to which the message is directed \u2014 the <i>receiver</i> \u2014 is not guaranteed to respond to a message, and if it does not, it raises an exception.\\n</p><p>Sending the message <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>method</span> to the object pointed to by the pointer <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>obj</span> would require the following code in C++:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In Objective-C, this is written as follows:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The \\"method\\" call is translated by the compiler to the <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>objc_msgSend(id self, SEL op, ...)</span> family of runtime functions. Different implementations handle modern additions like <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>super</span>. In GNU families this function is named <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>objc_msg_sendv</span>, but it has been deprecated in favor of a modern lookup system under <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>objc_msg_lookup</span>.\\n</p><p>Both styles of programming have multiple strengths and weaknesses. Object-oriented programming in the Simula (C++) style allows multiple inheritance and faster execution by using compile-time binding whenever possible, but it does not support dynamic binding by default. It also forces all methods to have a corresponding implementation unless they are abstract. The Smalltalk-style programming as used in Objective-C allows messages to go unimplemented, with the method resolved to its implementation at runtime. For example, a message may be sent to a collection of objects, to which only some will be expected to respond, without fear of producing runtime errors. Message passing also does not require that an object be defined at compile time. An implementation is still required for the method to be called in the derived object. (See the dynamic typing section below for more advantages of dynamic (late) binding.)\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Objective-C requires that the interface and implementation of a class be in separately declared code blocks. By convention, developers place the interface in a header file and the implementation in a code file. The header files, normally suffixed .h, are similar to C header files while the implementation (method) files, normally suffixed .m, can be very similar to C code files.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>This is analogous to class declarations as used in other object-oriented languages, such as C++ or Python.\\n</p><p>The interface of a class is usually defined in a header file. A common convention is to name the header file after the name of the class, e.g. <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Ball.h</span> would contain the interface for the class <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Ball</span>.\\n</p><p>An interface declaration takes the form:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In the above, plus signs denote class methods, or methods that can be called on the class itself (not on an instance), and minus signs denote instance methods, which can only be called on a particular instance of the class. Class methods also have no access to instance variables.\\n</p><p>The code above is roughly equivalent to the following C++ interface:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Note that <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>instanceMethod2With2Parameters:param2_callName:</span> demonstrates the interleaving of selector segments with argument expressions, for which there is no direct equivalent in C/C++.\\n</p><p>Return types can be any standard C type, a pointer to a generic Objective-C object, a pointer to a specific type of object such as NSArray *, NSImage *, or NSString *, or a pointer to the class to which the method belongs (instancetype). The default return type is the generic Objective-C type <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>id</span>.\\n</p><p>Method arguments begin with a name labeling the argument that is part of the method name, followed by a colon followed by the expected argument type in parentheses and the argument name. The label can be omitted.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>A derivative of the interface definition is the <i>category</i>, which allows one to add methods to existing classes.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The interface only declares the class interface and not the methods themselves: the actual code is written in the implementation file. Implementation (method) files normally have the file extension <code>.m</code>, which originally signified \\"messages\\".\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Methods are written using their interface declarations.\\nComparing Objective-C and C:\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>The syntax allows pseudo-naming of arguments.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Internal representations of a method vary between different implementations of Objective-C. If myColor is of the class <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Color</span>, instance method <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>-changeColorToRed:green:blue:</span> might be internally labeled <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>_i_Color_changeColorToRed_green_blue</span>. The <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>i</span> is to refer to an instance method, with the class and then method names appended and colons changed to underscores. As the order of parameters is part of the method name, it cannot be changed to suit coding style or expression as with true named parameters.\\n</p><p>However, internal names of the function are rarely used directly. Generally, messages are converted to function calls defined in the Objective-C runtime library. It is not necessarily known at link time which method will be called because the class of the receiver (the object being sent the message) need not be known until runtime.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Once an Objective-C class is written, it can be instantiated. This is done by first allocating an uninitialized instance of the class (an object) and then by initializing it. An object is not fully functional until both steps have been completed. These steps should be accomplished with one line of code so that there is never an allocated object that hasn\'t undergone initialization (and because it is unwise to keep the intermediate result since <code>-init</code> can return a different object than that on which it is called).\\n</p><p>Instantiation with the default, no-parameter initializer:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Instantiation with a custom initializer:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In the case where no custom initialization is being performed, the \\"new\\" method can often be used in place of the alloc-init messages:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Also, some classes implement class method initializers. Like <code>+new</code>, they combine <code>+alloc</code> and <code>-init</code>, but unlike <code>+new</code>, they return an autoreleased instance. Some class method initializers take parameters:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The <i>alloc</i> message allocates enough memory to hold all the instance variables for an object, sets all the instance variables to zero values, and turns the memory into an instance of the class; at no point during the initialization is the memory an instance of the superclass.\\n</p><p>The <i>init</i> message performs the set-up of the instance upon creation. The <i>init</i> method is often written as follows:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In the above example, notice the <code>id</code> return type. This type stands for \\"pointer to any object\\" in Objective-C (See the Dynamic typing section).\\n</p><p>The initializer pattern is used to assure that the object is properly initialized by its superclass before the init method performs its initialization. It performs the following actions:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>Line 2\\n<dl><dd>Sends the superclass instance an <i>init</i> message and assigns the result to <i>self</i> (pointer to the current object).</dd></dl></li>\\n<li>Line 3\\n<dl><dd>Checks if the returned object pointer is valid before performing any initialization.</dd></dl></li>\\n<li>Line 6\\n<dl><dd>Returns the value of self to the caller.</dd></dl></li></ul>\\n<p>A non-valid object pointer has the value <i>nil</i>; conditional statements like \\"if\\" treat nil like a null pointer, so the initialization code will not be executed if <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">[super init]</code> returned nil. If there is an error in initialization the init method should perform any necessary cleanup, including sending a \\"release\\" message to self, and return <i>nil</i> to indicate that initialization failed. Any checking for such errors must only be performed after having called the superclass initialization to ensure that destroying the object will be done correctly.\\n</p><p>If a class has more than one initialization method, only one of them (the \\"designated initializer\\") needs to follow this pattern; others should call the designated initializer instead of the superclass initializer.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In other programming languages, these are called \\"interfaces\\".\\n</p><p>Objective-C was extended at NeXT to introduce the concept of multiple inheritance of specification, but not implementation, through the introduction of protocols. This is a pattern achievable either as an abstract multiple inherited base class in C++, or as an \\"interface\\" (as in Java and C#). Objective-C makes use of ad hoc protocols called <i>informal protocols</i> and compiler-enforced protocols called <i>formal protocols</i>.\\n</p><p>An informal protocol is a list of methods that a class can opt to implement. It is specified in the documentation, since it has no presence in the language. Informal protocols are implemented as a category (see below) on NSObject and often include optional methods, which, if implemented, can change the behavior of a class. For example, a text field class might have a delegate that implements an informal protocol with an optional method for performing auto-completion of user-typed text. The text field discovers whether the delegate implements that method (via reflection) and, if so, calls the delegate\'s method to support the auto-complete feature.\\n</p><p>A formal protocol is similar to an interface in Java, C#, and Ada 2005. It is a list of methods that any class can declare itself to implement. Versions of Objective-C before 2.0 required that a class must implement all methods in a protocol it declares itself as adopting; the compiler will emit an error if the class does not implement every method from its declared protocols. Objective-C 2.0 added support for marking certain methods in a protocol optional, and the compiler will not enforce implementation of optional methods.\\n</p><p>A class must be declared to implement that protocol to be said to conform to it. This is detectable at runtime. Formal protocols cannot provide any implementations; they simply assure callers that classes that conform to the protocol will provide implementations. In the NeXT/Apple library, protocols are frequently used by the Distributed Objects system to represent the abilities of an object executing on a remote system.\\n</p><p>The syntax\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>denotes that there is the abstract idea of locking. By stating in the class definition that the protocol is implemented,\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>instances of NSLock claim that they will provide an implementation for the two instance methods.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Objective-C, like Smalltalk, can use dynamic typing: an object can be sent a message that is not specified in its interface. This can allow for increased flexibility, as it allows an object to \\"capture\\" a message and send the message to a different object that can respond to the message appropriately, or likewise send the message on to another object. This behavior is known as <i>message forwarding</i> or <i>delegation</i> (see below). Alternatively, an error handler can be used in case the message cannot be forwarded. If an object does not forward a message, respond to it, or handle an error, then the system will generate a runtime exception.  If messages are sent to <i>nil</i> (the null object pointer), they will be silently ignored or raise a generic exception, depending on compiler options.\\n</p><p>Static typing information may also optionally be added to variables. This information is then checked at compile time. In the following four statements, increasingly specific type information is provided. The statements are equivalent at runtime, but the extra information allows the compiler to warn the programmer if the passed argument does not match the type specified.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In the above statement, <i>foo</i> may be of any class.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In the above statement, <i>foo</i> may be an instance of any class that conforms to the <i><code>NSCopying</code></i> protocol.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In the above statement, <i>foo</i> must be an instance of the <i>NSNumber</i> class.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In the above statement, <i>foo</i> must be an instance of the <i>NSNumber</i> class, and it must conform to the <i><code>NSCopying</code></i> protocol.\\n</p><p>In Objective-C, all objects are represented as pointers, and static initialization is not allowed. The simplest object is the type that <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>id</span> (<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>objc_obj *</span>) points to, which only has an <i>isa</i> pointer describing its class. Other types from C, like values and structs, are unchanged because they are not part of the object system. This decision differs from the C++ object model, where structs and classes are united.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Objective-C permits the sending of a message to an object that may not respond. Rather than responding or simply dropping the message, an object can forward the message to an object that can respond. Forwarding can be used to simplify implementation of certain design patterns, such as the observer pattern or the proxy pattern.\\n</p><p>The Objective-C runtime specifies a pair of methods in <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Object</span>\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>forwarding methods:</li>\\n<li>action methods:</li></ul>\\n<p>An object wishing to implement forwarding needs only to override the forwarding method with a new method to define the forwarding behavior. The action method <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>performv::</span> need not be overridden, as this method merely performs an action based on the selector and arguments. Notice the <code>SEL</code> type, which is the type of messages in Objective-C.\\n</p><p>Note: in OpenStep, Cocoa, and GNUstep, the commonly used frameworks of Objective-C, one does not use the <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Object</span> class.

In this circumstance, it is safe to ignore the warning since forwarding was implemented. Running the program produces this output:\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>During the design of Objective-C, one of the main concerns was the maintainability of large code bases. Experience from the structured programming world had shown that one of the main ways to improve code was to break it down into smaller pieces. Objective-C borrowed and extended the concept of <i>categories</i> from Smalltalk implementations to help with this process.\\n</p><p>Furthermore, the methods within a category are added to a class at run-time. Thus, categories permit the programmer to add methods to an existing class - an open class - without the need to recompile that class or even have access to its source code. For example, if a system does not contain a spell checker in its String implementation, it could be added without modifying the String source code.\\n</p><p>Methods within categories become indistinguishable from the methods in a class when the program is run. A category has full access to all of the instance variables within the class, including private variables.\\n</p><p>If a category declares a method with the same method signature as an existing method in a class, the category\'s method is adopted. Thus categories can not only add methods to a class, but also replace existing methods. This feature can be used to fix bugs in other classes by rewriting their methods, or to cause a global change to a class\'s behavior within a program. If two categories have methods with the same name but different method signatures, it is undefined which category\'s method is adopted.\\n</p><p>Other languages have attempted to add this feature in a variety of ways. TOM took the Objective-C system a step further and allowed for the addition of variables also. Other languages have used prototype-based solutions instead, the most notable being Self.\\n</p><p>The C# and Visual Basic.NET languages implement superficially similar functionality in the form of extension methods, but these lack access to the private variables of the class. Ruby and several other dynamic programming languages refer to the technique as \\"monkey patching\\".\\n</p><p>Logtalk implements a concept of categories (as first-class entities) that subsumes Objective-C categories functionality (Logtalk categories can also be used as fine-grained units of composition when defining e.g. new classes or prototypes; in particular, a Logtalk category can be virtually imported by any number of classes and prototypes).\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>This example builds up an <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Integer</span> class, by defining first a basic class with only accessor methods implemented, and adding two categories, <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Arithmetic</span> and <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Display</span>, which extend the basic class. While categories can access the base class\'s private data members, it is often good practice to access these private data members through the accessor methods, which helps keep categories more independent from the base class. Implementing such accessors is one typical use of categories. Another is to use categories to add methods to the base class. However, it is not regarded as good practice to use categories for subclass overriding, also known as monkey patching. Informal protocols are implemented as a category on the base <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>NSObject</span> class. By convention, files containing categories that extend base classes will take the name <u>BaseClass+ExtensionClass.h</u>.\\n</p>\\n<dl><dt><i>Integer.h</i></dt>\\n<dd></dd></dl>\\n<dl><dt><i>Integer.m</i></dt>\\n<dd></dd></dl>\\n<dl><dt><i>Integer+Arithmetic.h</i></dt>\\n<dd></dd></dl>\\n<dl><dt><i>Integer+Arithmetic.m</i></dt>\\n<dd></dd></dl>\\n<dl><dt><i>Integer+Display.h</i></dt>\\n<dd></dd></dl>\\n<dl><dt><i>Integer+Display.m</i></dt>\\n<dd></dd></dl>\\n<dl><dt><i>main.m</i></dt>\\n<dd></dd></dl>\\n\\n<p>Compilation is performed, for example, by:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>One can experiment by leaving out the <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-objc mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>#import \\"Integer+Arithmetic.h\\"</span></code> (line 2) and <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-objc mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>[</span><span>num1</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span>:</span><span>num2</span><span>]</span></code> (line 21) and omitting <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>Integer+Arithmetic.m</span> in compilation. The program will still run. This means that it is possible to <i>mix-and-match</i> added categories if needed; if a category does not need to have some ability, it can simply not be compile in.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Objective-C permits a class to wholly replace another class within a program. The replacing class is said to \\"pose as\\" the target class.\\n</p><p>Class posing was declared deprecated with Mac OS X v10.5, and is unavailable in the 64-bit runtime. Similar functionality can be achieved by using method swizzling in categories, that swaps one method\'s implementation with another\'s that have the same signature.\\n</p><p>For the versions still supporting posing, all messages sent to the target class are instead received by the posing class. There are several restrictions:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>A class may only pose as one of its direct or indirect superclasses.</li>\\n<li>The posing class must not define any new instance variables that are absent from the target class (though it may define or override methods).</li>\\n<li>The target class may not have received any messages prior to the posing.</li></ul>\\n<p>Posing, similarly with categories, allows global augmentation of existing classes. Posing permits two features absent from categories:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>A posing class can call overridden methods through super, thus incorporating the implementation of the target class.</li>\\n<li>A posing class can override methods defined in categories.</li></ul>\\n<p>For example,\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>This intercepts every invocation of setMainMenu to NSApplication.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In the C language, the <code>#include</code> pre-compile directive always causes a file\'s contents to be inserted into the source at that point. Objective-C has the <code>#import</code> directive, equivalent except that each file is included only once per compilation unit, obviating the need for include guards.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Objective-C\'s features often allow for flexible, and often easy, solutions to programming issues.\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>Delegating methods to other objects and remote invocation can be easily implemented using categories and message forwarding.</li>\\n<li>Swizzling of the <var>isa</var> pointer allows for classes to change at runtime. Typically used for debugging where freed objects are swizzled into zombie objects whose only purpose is to report an error when someone calls them. Swizzling was also used in Enterprise Objects Framework to create database faults. Swizzling is used today by Apple\'s Foundation Framework to implement Key-Value Observing.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n<p>Objective-C++ is a language variant accepted by the front-end to the GNU Compiler Collection and Clang, which can compile source files that use a combination of C++ and Objective-C syntax. Objective-C++ adds to C++ the extensions that Objective-C adds to C. As nothing is done to unify the semantics behind the various language features, certain restrictions apply:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>A C++ class cannot derive from an Objective-C class and vice versa.</li>\\n<li>C++ namespaces cannot be declared inside an Objective-C declaration.</li>\\n<li>Objective-C declarations may appear only in global scope, not inside a C++ namespace</li>\\n<li>Objective-C classes cannot have instance variables of C++ classes that lack a default constructor or that have one or more virtual methods, but pointers to C++ objects can be used as instance variables without restriction (allocate them with new in the -init method).</li>\\n<li>C++ \\"by value\\" semantics cannot be applied to Objective-C objects, which are only accessible through pointers.</li>\\n<li>An Objective-C declaration cannot be within a C++ template declaration and vice versa. However, Objective-C types (e.g., <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">Classname *</code>) can be used as C++ template parameters.</li>\\n<li>Objective-C and C++ exception handling is distinct; the handlers of each cannot handle exceptions of the other type. As a result, object destructors are not run. This is mitigated in recent \\"Objective-C 2.0\\" runtimes as Objective-C exceptions are either replaced by C++ exceptions completely (Apple runtime), or partly when Objective-C++ library is linked (GNUstep libobjc2).</li>\\n<li>Objective-C blocks and C++11 lambdas are distinct entities. However, a block is transparently generated on macOS when passing a lambda where a block is expected.</li></ul>\\n\\n<p>At the 2006 Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced the release of \\"Objective-C 2.0,\\" a revision of the Objective-C language to include \\"modern garbage collection, syntax enhancements, runtime performance improvements, and 64-bit support\\". Mac OS X v10.5, released in October 2007, included an Objective-C 2.0 compiler. GCC 4.6 supports many new Objective-C features, such as declared and synthesized properties, dot syntax, fast enumeration, optional protocol methods, method/protocol/class attributes, class extensions, and a new GNU Objective-C runtime API.\\n</p><p>The naming Objective-C 2.0 represents a break in the versioning system of the language, as the last Objective-C version for NeXT was \\"objc4\\". This project name was kept in the last release of legacy Objective-C runtime source code in Mac OS X Leopard (10.5).\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Objective-C 2.0 provided an optional conservative, generational garbage collector. When run in backwards-compatible mode, the runtime turned reference counting operations such as \\"retain\\" and \\"release\\" into no-ops. All objects were subject to garbage collection when garbage collection was enabled. Regular C pointers could be qualified with \\"__strong\\" to also trigger the underlying write-barrier compiler intercepts and thus participate in garbage collection. A zero-ing weak subsystem was also provided such that pointers marked as \\"__weak\\" are set to zero when the object (or more simply, GC memory) is collected. The garbage collector does not exist on the iOS implementation of Objective-C 2.0. Garbage collection in Objective-C runs on a low-priority background thread, and can halt on user events, with the intention of keeping the user experience responsive.\\n</p><p>Garbage collection was deprecated in Mac OS X v10.8 in favor of Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).  Objective-C on iOS 7 running on ARM64 uses 19 bits out of a 64-bit word to store the reference count, as a form of tagged pointers.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Objective-C 2.0 introduces a new syntax to declare instance variables as properties, with optional attributes to configure the generation of accessor methods. Properties are, in a sense, public instance variables; that is, declaring an instance variable as a property provides external classes with access (possibly limited, e.g. read only) to that property. A property may be declared as \\"readonly\\", and may be provided with storage semantics such as <code>assign</code>, <code>copy</code> or <code>retain</code>. By default, properties are considered <code>atomic</code>, which results in a lock preventing multiple threads from accessing them at the same time. A property can be declared as <code>nonatomic</code>, which removes this lock.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Properties are implemented by way of the <code>@synthesize</code> keyword, which generates getter (and setter, if not read-only) methods according to the property declaration. Alternatively, the getter and setter methods must be implemented explicitly, or the <code>@dynamic</code> keyword can be used to indicate that accessor methods will be provided by other means. When compiled using clang 3.1 or higher, all properties which are not explicitly declared with <code>@dynamic</code>, marked <code>readonly</code> or have complete user-implemented getter and setter will be automatically implicitly <code>@synthesize</code>\'d.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Properties can be accessed using the traditional message passing syntax, dot notation, or, in Key-Value Coding, by name via the \\"valueForKey:\\"/\\"setValue:forKey:\\" methods.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In order to use dot notation to invoke property accessors within an instance method, the \\"self\\" keyword should be used:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>A class or protocol\'s properties may be dynamically introspected.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Objective-C 2.0 provides non-fragile instance variables where supported by the runtime (i.e. when building code for 64-bit macOS, and all iOS). Under the modern runtime, an extra layer of indirection is added to instance variable access, allowing the dynamic linker to adjust instance layout at runtime. This feature allows for two important improvements to Objective-C code:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>It eliminates the fragile binary interface problem; superclasses can change sizes without affecting binary compatibility.</li>\\n<li>It allows instance variables that provide the backing for properties to be synthesized at runtime without them being declared in the class\'s interface.</li></ul>\\n\\n<p>Instead of using an NSEnumerator object or indices to iterate through a collection, Objective-C 2.0 offers the fast enumeration syntax. In Objective-C 2.0, the following loops are functionally equivalent, but have different performance traits.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fast enumeration generates more efficient code than standard enumeration because method calls to enumerate over objects are replaced by pointer arithmetic using the NSFastEnumeration protocol.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>A class extension has the same syntax as a category declaration with no category name, and the methods and properties declared in it are added directly to the main class. It is mostly used as an alternative to a category to add methods to a class without advertising them in the public headers, with the advantage that for class extensions the compiler checks that all the privately declared methods are actually implemented.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>All Objective-C applications developed for macOS that make use of the above improvements for Objective-C 2.0 are incompatible with all operating systems prior to 10.5 (Leopard). Since fast enumeration does not generate exactly the same binaries as standard enumeration, its use will cause an application to crash on Mac OS X version 10.4 or earlier.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Blocks is a nonstandard extension for Objective-C (and C and C++) that uses special syntax to create closures. Blocks are only supported in Mac OS X 10.6 \\"Snow Leopard\\" or later, iOS 4 or later, and GNUstep with libobjc2 1.7 and compiling with clang 3.1 or later.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Apple has added some additional features to Objective 2.0 over time. The additions only apply to the \\"Apple LLVM compiler\\", i.e. clang frontend of the language. Confusingly, the versioning used by Apple differs from that of the LLVM upstream; refer to Xcode \xa7\xa0Toolchain versions for a translation to open-source LLVM version numbers.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is a compile-time feature that eliminates the need for programmers to manually manage retain counts using <code>retain</code> and <code>release</code>.  Unlike garbage collection, which occurs at run time, ARC eliminates the overhead of a separate process managing retain counts. ARC and manual memory management are not mutually exclusive; programmers can continue to use non-ARC code in ARC-enabled projects by disabling ARC for individual code files. Xcode can also attempt to automatically upgrade a project to ARC.\\n</p><p>ARC was introduced in LLVM 3.0. This translates to Xcode 4.2 (2011), or Apple LLVM compiler 3.0.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>NeXT and Apple Obj-C runtimes have long included a short-form way to create new strings, using the literal syntax <code>@\\"a new string\\"</code>, or drop to CoreFoundation constants <code>kCFBooleanTrue</code> and <code>kCFBooleanFalse</code> for <code>NSNumber</code> with Boolean values. Using this format saves the programmer from having to use the longer <code>initWithString</code> or similar methods when doing certain operations.\\n</p><p>When using Apple LLVM compiler 4.0 (Xcode 4.4) or later, arrays, dictionaries, and numbers (<code>NSArray</code>, <code>NSDictionary</code>, <code>NSNumber</code> classes) can also be created using literal syntax instead of methods. (Apple LLVM compiler 4.0 translates to open source LLVM and Clang 3.1.)\\n</p><p>Example without literals:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Example with literals:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>However, different from string literals, which compile to constants in the executable, these literals compile to code equivalent to the above method calls. In particular, under manually reference-counted memory management, these objects are autoreleased, which requires added care when e.g., used with function-static variables or other kinds of globals.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>When using Apple LLVM compiler 4.0 or later, arrays and dictionaries (<code>NSArray</code> and <code>NSDictionary</code> classes) can be manipulated using subscripting.  Subscripting can be used to retrieve values from indexes (array) or keys (dictionary), and with mutable objects, can also be used to set objects to indexes or keys. In code, subscripting is represented using brackets <code>[ ]</code>.\\n</p><p>Example without subscripting:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Example with subscripting:\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>After the purchase of NeXT by Apple, attempts were made to make the language more acceptable to programmers more familiar with Java than Smalltalk. One of these attempts was introducing what was dubbed \\"Modern Syntax\\" for Objective-C at the time (as opposed to the current, \\"classic\\" syntax). There was no change in behaviour, this was merely an alternative syntax. Instead of writing a method invocation like\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>It was instead written as\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Similarly, declarations went from the form\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>to\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>This \\"modern\\" syntax is no longer supported in current dialects of the Objective-C language.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The mulle-objc project is another re-implementation of Objective-C. It supports GCC or Clang/LLVM compilers as backends. It diverges from other runtimes in terms of syntax, semantics and ABI compatibility. It supports Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Besides the GCC/NeXT/Apple implementation, which added several extensions to the original Stepstone implementation, another free, open-source Objective-C implementation called the Portable Object Compiler also exists. The set of extensions implemented by the Portable Object Compiler differs from the GCC/NeXT/Apple implementation; in particular, it includes Smalltalk-like blocks for Objective-C, while it lacks protocols and categories, two features used extensively in OpenStep and its derivatives and relatives. Overall, POC represents an older, pre-NeXT stage in the language\'s evolution, roughly conformant to Brad Cox\'s 1991 book.\\n</p><p>It also includes a runtime library called ObjectPak, which is based on Cox\'s original ICPak101 library (which in turn derives from the Smalltalk-80 class library), and is quite radically different from the OpenStep FoundationKit.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The PC GEOS system used a programming language known as <b>GEOS Objective-C</b> or <b>goc</b>; despite the name similarity, the two languages are similar only in overall concept and the use of keywords prefixed with an @ sign.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The Clang compiler suite, part of the LLVM project, implements Objective-C and other languages. After GCC 4.3 (2008) switched to GPLv3, Apple abandoned it in favor of clang, a compiler it has more legal power to modify. As a result, many of the modern Objective-C language features are supported only by Clang.\\n</p><p>Apple\'s versioning scheme for its clang-based \\"LLVM compiler\\" differs from the LLVM\'s open-source versioning. See Xcode \xa7\xa0Toolchain versions for a translation\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The GNU project has, for a long time, been interested in a platform to port NeXT and Obj-C programs to. The ChangeLog for the <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>libobjc</span> directory in GCC suggests that it existed before 1998 (GCC 2.95), and its README further points at a rewrite in 1993 (GCC 2.4).\\n</p><p>The NeXT frontend source code was released since it was made as part of GCC, released GNU General Public License which forces ones making derivative works to do so. Apple continued this tradition in releasing its fork of GCC up to 4.2.1, after which they abandoned the compiler. GCC maintainers took in the changes, but did not invest much in supporting newer features such as the Objective-C 2.0 language.<sup class=\\"reference nowrap\\"><span title=\\"Location: Which compiler\\">:\u200aWhich compiler\u200a</span></sup>\\n</p><p>The GNUstep developers, interested in the new language, forked the GCC <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>libobjc</span> to a project independent of GCC called <link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049734\\"><span>libobjc2</span> in 2009.

Combined with its own implementation of Cocoa Touch and underlying APIs, the project allows the reuse of iOS Application code inside of UWP apps.\\n</p><p>On Windows, Objective-C Development tools are provided for download on GNUStep\'s website.  The GNUStep Development System consists of the following packages: GNUstep MSYS System, GNUstep Core, GNUstep Devel, GNUstep Cairo, ProjectCenter IDE (Like Xcode, but not as complex), Gorm (Interface Builder Like Xcode NIB builder). These binary installers have not been updated since 2016, so it could be a better idea to just install by building under Cygwin or MSYS2 instead.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Objective-C today is often used in tandem with a fixed library of standard objects (often known as a \\"kit\\" or \\"framework\\"), such as Cocoa, GNUstep or ObjFW. These libraries often come with the operating system: the GNUstep libraries often come with Linux-based distributions and Cocoa comes with macOS. The programmer is not forced to inherit functionality from the existing base class (NSObject / OFObject). Objective-C allows for the declaration of new root classes that do not inherit any existing functionality. Originally, Objective-C-based programming environments typically offered an Object class as the base class from which almost all other classes inherited. With the introduction of OpenStep, NeXT created a new base class named NSObject, which offered additional features over Object (an emphasis on using object references and reference counting instead of raw pointers, for example). Almost all classes in Cocoa inherit from NSObject.\\n</p><p>Not only did the renaming serve to differentiate the new default behavior of classes within the OpenStep API, but it allowed code that used Object\u2014the original base class used on NeXTSTEP (and, more or less, other Objective-C class libraries)\u2014to co-exist in the same runtime with code that used NSObject (with some limitations). The introduction of the two letter prefix also became a simplistic form of namespaces, which Objective-C lacks. Using a prefix to create an informal packaging identifier became an informal coding standard in the Objective-C community, and continues to this day.\\n</p><p>More recently, package managers have started appearing, such as CocoaPods, which aims to be both a package manager and a repository of packages. A lot of open-source Objective-C code that was written in the last few years can now be installed using CocoaPods.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1097763485\\">\\n<p>Objective-C implementations use a thin runtime system written in C, which adds little to the size of the application. In contrast, most object-oriented systems at the time that it was created used large virtual machine runtimes. Programs written in Objective-C tend to be not much larger than the size of their code and that of the libraries (which generally do not need to be included in the software distribution), in contrast to Smalltalk systems where a large amount of memory was used just to open a window. Objective-C applications tend to be larger than similar C or C++ applications because Objective-C dynamic typing does not allow methods to be stripped or inlined. Since the programmer has such freedom to delegate, forward calls, build selectors on the fly, and pass them to the runtime system, the Objective-C compiler cannot assume it is safe to remove unused methods or to inline calls.\\n</p><p>Likewise, the language can be implemented atop extant C compilers (in GCC, first as a preprocessor, then as a module) rather than as a new compiler. This allows Objective-C to leverage the huge existing collection of C code, libraries, tools, etc. Existing C libraries can be wrapped in Objective-C wrappers to provide an OO-style interface. In this aspect, it is similar to GObject library and Vala language, which are widely used in development of GTK applications.\\n</p><p>All of these practical changes lowered the barrier to entry, likely the biggest problem for the widespread acceptance of Smalltalk in the 1980s.\\n</p><p>A common criticism is that Objective-C does not have language support for namespaces. Instead, programmers are forced to add prefixes to their class names, which are traditionally shorter than namespace names and thus more prone to collisions. As of 2007, all macOS classes and functions in the Cocoa programming environment are prefixed with \\"NS\\" (e.g. NSObject, NSButton) to identify them as belonging to the macOS or iOS core; the \\"NS\\" derives from the names of the classes as defined during the development of NeXTSTEP.\\n</p><p>Since Objective-C is a strict superset of C, it does not treat C primitive types as first-class objects.\\n</p><p>Unlike C++, Objective-C does not support operator overloading. Also unlike C++, Objective-C allows an object to directly inherit only from one class (forbidding multiple inheritance). However, in most cases, categories and protocols may be used as alternative ways to achieve the same results.\\n</p><p>Because Objective-C uses dynamic runtime typing and because all method calls are function calls (or, in some cases, syscalls), many common performance optimizations cannot be applied to Objective-C methods (for example: inlining, constant propagation, interprocedural optimizations, and scalar replacement of aggregates). This limits the performance of Objective-C abstractions relative to similar abstractions in languages such as C++ where such optimizations are possible.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The first versions of Objective-C did not support garbage collection. At the time this decision was a matter of some debate, and many people considered long \\"dead times\\" (when Smalltalk performed collection) to render the entire system unusable. Some 3rd party implementations have added this feature (most notably GNUstep using Boehm), and Apple has implemented it as of Mac OS X v10.5. However, in more recent versions of macOS and iOS, garbage collection has been deprecated in favor of Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), introduced in 2011.\\n</p><p>With ARC, the compiler inserts retain and release calls automatically into Objective-C code based on static code analysis. The automation relieves the programmer of having to write in memory management code. ARC also adds weak references to the Objective-C language.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The design and implementation of C++ and Objective-C represent fundamentally different approaches to extending C.\\n</p><p>In addition to C\'s style of procedural programming, C++ directly supports certain forms of object-oriented programming, generic programming, and metaprogramming. C++ also comes with a large standard library that includes several container classes. Similarly, Objective-C adds object-oriented programming, dynamic typing, and reflection to C. Objective-C does not provide a standard library <i>per se</i>, but in most places where Objective-C is used, it is used with an OpenStep-like library such as OPENSTEP, Cocoa, or GNUstep, which provides functionality similar to C++\'s standard library.\\n</p><p>One notable difference is that Objective-C provides runtime support for reflective features, whereas C++ adds only a small amount of runtime support to C. In Objective-C, an object can be queried about its own properties, e.g., whether it will respond to a certain message. In C++, this is not possible without the use of external libraries.\\n</p><p>The use of reflection is part of the wider distinction between dynamic (run-time) features and static (compile-time) features of a language. Although Objective-C and C++ each employ a mix of both features, Objective-C is decidedly geared toward run-time decisions while C++ is geared toward compile-time decisions. The tension between dynamic and static programming involves many of the classic trade-offs in programming: dynamic features add flexibility, static features add speed and type checking.\\n</p><p>Generic programming and metaprogramming can be implemented in both languages using runtime polymorphism. In C++ this takes the form of virtual functions and runtime type identification, while Objective-C offers dynamic typing and reflection. Both Objective-C and C++ support compile-time polymorphism (generic functions), with Objective-C only adding this feature in 2015.\\n</p>\\n\\n<ul><li>C (programming language)</li>\\n<li>C++</li>\\n<li>Comparison of programming languages</li>\\n<li>Comparison with COM, GObject, SOM, Windows Runtime, XPCOM</li>\\n<li>Swift (programming language)</li>\\n<li>Xcode</li>\\n<li>WinObjC (aka: Windows Bridge for iOS)</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Programming with Objective-C, from Apple (2012-12-13)</li>\\n<li><i>The Objective-C Programming Language</i>, from Apple (2011-10-11)</li>\\n<li><i>Objective-C Runtime Programming Guide</i>, from Apple (2009-10-19)</li>\\n<li>Objective-C GNUstep Base Programming Manual</li>\\n<li>Objective-C by Brad Cox</li>\\n<li>Objective-C FAQ</li>\\n<li>Objective-C Example</li></ul>","image_url":"","repositories":[{"name_with_owner":"keycastr/keycastr","url":"https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr","description":"KeyCastr, an open-source keystroke visualizer","homepage_url":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7377825?s=80&v=4","num_forks":502,"num_issues":13,"num_pull_requests":2,"num_stars":12262,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":13,"color":"c5def5"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Objective-C"]},{"name_with_owner":"Hammerspoon/hammerspoon","url":"https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon","description":"Staggeringly powerful macOS desktop automation with Lua","homepage_url":"http://www.hammerspoon.org","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9214848?s=80&v=4","num_forks":579,"num_issues":15,"num_pull_requests":11,"num_stars":11711,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":15,"color":"159818"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Objective-C","Lua","Makefile","Ruby","C","Shell","HTML","CSS","C++","Python"]},{"name_with_owner":"Tencent/QMUI_iOS","url":"https://github.com/Tencent/QMUI_iOS","description":"QMUI iOS\u2014\u2014\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u9879\u76ee UI \u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848","homepage_url":"http://qmuiteam.com/ios","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18461506?s=80&v=4","num_forks":1367,"num_issues":19,"num_pull_requests":6,"num_stars":7055,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":19,"color":"c5def5"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Objective-C","Ruby","Python"]},{"name_with_owner":"tisfeng/Easydict","url":"https://github.com/tisfeng/Easydict","description":"\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u6d01\u4f18\u96c5\u7684\u8bcd\u5178\u7ffb\u8bd1 macOS App\u3002\u5f00\u7bb1\u5373\u7528\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u79bb\u7ebf OCR \u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9053\u8bcd\u5178\uff0c\ud83c\udf4e \u82f9\u679c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bcd\u5178\uff0c\ud83c\udf4e \u82f9\u679c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0cOpenAI\uff0cGemini\uff0cDeepL\uff0cGoogle\uff0cBing\uff0c\u817e\u8baf\uff0c\u767e\u5ea6\uff0c\u963f\u91cc\uff0c\u5c0f\u725b\uff0c\u5f69\u4e91\u548c\u706b\u5c71\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002A concise and elegant Dictionary and Translator macOS App for looking up words and translating text.

Though Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms in use, including \\"Practical Extraction and Reporting Language\\".\\n</p><p>Perl was developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Perl originally was not capitalized and the name was changed to being capitalized by the time Perl 4 was released. The latest release is Perl 5, first released in 1994. From 2000 to October 2019 a sixth version of Perl was in development; the sixth version\'s name was changed to Raku. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams which liberally borrow ideas from each other.\\n</p><p>Perl borrows features from other programming languages including C, sh, AWK, and sed. It provides text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools. Perl is a highly expressive programming language: source code for a given algorithm can be short and highly compressible.\\n</p><p>Perl gained widespread popularity in the mid-1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its powerful regular expression and string parsing abilities. In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for GUIs. It has been nicknamed \\"the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages\\" because of its flexibility and power. In 1998, it was also referred to as the \\"duct tape that holds the Internet together\\", in reference to both its ubiquitous use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.\\n</p>","image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/56/Perl_language_logo.svg/316px-Perl_language_logo.svg.png","repositories":[{"name_with_owner":"mojolicious/mojo","url":"https://github.com/mojolicious/mojo","description":":sparkles: Mojolicious - Perl real-time web framework","homepage_url":"https://mojolicious.org","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388868?s=80&v=4","num_forks":577,"num_issues":19,"num_pull_requests":20,"num_stars":2659,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","count":19,"color":"1D094C"},{"name":"good first issue","count":2,"color":"77ff75"}],"issues":[],"languages":["Perl","XProc","Mathematica","CSS","JavaScript"]},{"name_with_owner":"Difegue/LANraragi","url":"https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi","description":"Web application for archival and reading of manga/doujinshi.

PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.\\n</p><p>The PHP language has evolved without a written formal specification or standard, with the original implementation acting as the <i>de facto</i> standard that other implementations aimed to follow. \\n</p><p>W3Techs reports that as of 23\xa0May\xa02024 (the six months after the PHP 8.3 release), PHP is used by 76.2% of all websites whose programming language could be determined, and 55.1% thereof use PHP 7 which is outdated and known to be insecure.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>PHP development began in 1993 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C, which he used to maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with databases, and called this implementation \\"Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter\\" or PHP/FI.\\n</p><p>An example of the early PHP syntax:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>PHP/FI could be used to build simple, dynamic web applications. To accelerate bug reporting and improve the code, Lerdorf initially announced the release of PHP/FI as \\"Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0\\" on the Usenet discussion group <i>comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi</i> on 8 June 1995. This release included basic functionality such as Perl-like variables, form handling, and the ability to embed HTML. By this point, the syntax had changed to resemble that of Perl, but was simpler, more limited, and less consistent.\\n</p><p>Early PHP was never intended to be a new programming language; rather, it grew organically, with Lerdorf noting in retrospect: \\"I don\'t know how to stop it [...] there was never any intent to write a programming language [...] I have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language [...] I just kept adding the next logical step on the way.\\" A development team began to form and, after months of work and beta testing, officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997.\\n</p><p>The fact that PHP was not originally designed, but instead was developed organically has led to inconsistent naming of functions and inconsistent ordering of their parameters. In some cases, the function names were chosen to match the lower-level libraries which PHP was \\"wrapping\\", while in some very early versions of PHP the length of the function names was used internally as a hash function, so names were chosen to improve the distribution of hash values.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the base of PHP\xa03, changing the language\'s name to the recursive acronym <i>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</i>. Afterwards, public testing of PHP\xa03 began, and the official launch came in June 1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a new rewrite of PHP\'s core, producing the Zend Engine in 1999. They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, Israel.\\n</p><p>On 22 May 2000, PHP 4, powered by the Zend Engine 1.0, was released. By August 2008, this branch had reached version 4.4.9. PHP\xa04 is now no longer under development and nor are any security updates planned to be released.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>On 1 July 2004, PHP 5 was released, powered by the new Zend Engine II. PHP\xa05 included new features such as improved support for object-oriented programming, the PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension (which defines a lightweight and consistent interface for accessing databases), and numerous performance enhancements. In 2008, PHP\xa05 became the only stable version under development. Late static binding had been missing from previous versions of PHP, and was added in version 5.3.\\n</p><p>Many high-profile open-source projects ceased to support PHP\xa04 in new code from February 5, 2008, because of the GoPHP5 initiative, provided by a consortium of PHP developers promoting the transition from PHP\xa04 to PHP\xa05.\\n</p><p>Over time, PHP interpreters became available on most existing 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems, either by building them from the PHP source code or by using pre-built binaries. For PHP versions 5.3 and 5.4, the only available Microsoft Windows binary distributions were 32-bit IA-32 builds, requiring Windows 32-bit compatibility mode while using Internet Information Services (IIS) on a 64-bit Windows platform. PHP version 5.5 made the 64-bit x86-64 builds available for Microsoft Windows.\\n</p><p>Official security support for PHP 5.6 ended on 31 December 2018.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>PHP received mixed reviews due to lacking native Unicode support at the core language level. In 2005, a project headed by Andrei Zmievski was initiated to bring native Unicode support throughout PHP, by embedding the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library, and representing text strings as UTF-16 internally. Since this would cause major changes both to the internals of the language and to user code, it was planned to release this as version 6.0 of the language, along with other major features then in development.\\n</p><p>However, a shortage of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project. As a result, a PHP\xa05.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP\xa06, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project in its current form was officially abandoned, and a PHP\xa05.4 release was prepared to contain most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP\xa06, such as traits and closure re-binding. Initial hopes were that a new plan would be formed for Unicode integration, but by 2014 none had been adopted.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>During 2014 and 2015, a new major PHP version was developed, PHP\xa07. The numbering of this version involved some debate among internal developers. While the PHP\xa06 Unicode experiments had never been released, several articles and book titles referenced the PHP\xa06 names, which might have caused confusion if a new release were to reuse the name. After a vote, the name PHP\xa07 was chosen.\\n</p><p>The foundation of PHP\xa07 is a PHP branch that was originally dubbed <i>PHP next generation</i> (<i>phpng</i>). It was authored by Dmitry Stogov, Xinchen Hui and Nikita Popov, and aimed to optimize PHP performance by refactoring the Zend Engine while retaining near-complete language compatibility. By 14 July 2014, WordPress-based benchmarks, which served as the main benchmark suite for the phpng project, showed an almost 100% increase in performance. Changes from phpng make it easier to improve performance in future versions, as more compact data structures and other changes are seen as better suited for a successful migration to a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Because of the significant changes, the reworked Zend Engine was called <i>Zend Engine 3</i>, succeeding Zend Engine 2 used in PHP\xa05.\\n</p><p>Because of the major internal changes in phpng, it must receive a new major version number of PHP, rather than a minor PHP\xa05 release, according to PHP\'s release process. Major versions of PHP are allowed to break backward-compatibility of code and therefore PHP\xa07 presented an opportunity for other improvements beyond phpng that require backward-compatibility breaks. In particular, it involved the following changes:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>Many fatal or recoverable-level legacy PHP error mechanisms were replaced with modern object-oriented exceptions.</li>\\n<li>The syntax for variable dereferencing was reworked to be internally more consistent and complete, allowing the use of the operators <code>-&gt;</code>, <code>[]</code>, <code>()</code>,<code>{}</code>, and <code>::</code>, with arbitrary meaningful left-side expressions.</li>\\n<li>Support for legacy PHP\xa04-style constructor methods was deprecated.</li>\\n<li>The behavior of the <code>foreach</code> statement was changed to be more predictable.</li>\\n<li>Constructors for the few classes built-in to PHP which returned null upon failure were changed to throw an exception instead, for consistency.</li>\\n<li>Several unmaintained or deprecated server application programming interfaces (SAPIs) and extensions were removed from the PHP core, most notably the legacy <code>mysql</code> extension.</li>\\n<li>The behavior of the <code>list()</code> operator was changed to remove support for strings.</li>\\n<li>Support was removed for legacy ASP-style delimiters <code>&lt;%</code> and <code>%&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script language=\\"php\\"&gt; ... &lt;/script&gt;</code>.</li>\\n<li>An oversight allowing a switch statement to have multiple <code>default</code> clauses was fixed.</li>\\n<li>Support for hexadecimal number support in some implicit conversions from strings to number types was removed.</li>\\n<li>The left-shift and right-shift operators were changed to behave more consistently across platforms.</li>\\n<li>Conversions between floating-point numbers and integers were changed (e.g. infinity changed to convert to zero) and implemented more consistently across platforms.</li></ul>\\n<p>PHP\xa07 also included new language features. Most notably, it introduced return type declarations for functions which complement the existing parameter type declarations, and support for the scalar types (integer, float, string, and boolean) in parameter and return type declarations.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>PHP\xa08 was released on 26 November 2020, and is currently the second-most used PHP major version. PHP\xa08 is a major version and has breaking changes from previous versions. New features and notable changes include:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Just-in-time compilation is supported in PHP\xa08.\\n</p><p>PHP 8\'s JIT compiler can provide substantial performance improvements for some use cases, while PHP developer Nikita Popov stated that the performance improvements for most websites will be less substantial than the upgrade from PHP\xa05 to PHP\xa07. Substantial improvements are expected more for mathematical-type operations than for common web-development use cases. Additionally, the JIT compiler provides the future potential to move some code from C to PHP, due to the performance improvements for some use cases.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>PHP 8 introduced the <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">match</code> expression. The match expression is conceptually similar to a <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">switch</code> statement and is more compact for some use cases. Because <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">match</code> is an expression, its result can be assigned to a variable or returned from a function.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>PHP 8 introduced union types, a new <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">static</code> return type, and a new <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">mixed</code> type.\\n</p><p>\\"Attributes\\", often referred to as \\"annotations\\" in other programming languages, were added in PHP\xa08, which allow metadata to be added to classes.\\n</p><p><code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">throw</code> was changed from being a statement to being an expression. This allows exceptions to be thrown in places that were not previously possible.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>PHP\xa08 includes changes to allow alternate, more concise, or more consistent syntaxes in a number of scenarios. For example, the nullsafe operator is similar to the null coalescing operator <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">??</code>, but used when calling methods. The following code snippet will not throw an error if <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">getBirthday()</code> returns null:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Constructor property promotion has been added as \\"syntactic sugar,\\" allowing class properties to be set automatically when parameters are passed into a class constructor. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code that must be written.\\n</p><p>Other minor changes include support for use of <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">::class</code> on objects, which serves as an alternative for the use of <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">get_class()</code>; non-capturing catches in try-catch blocks; variable syntax tweaks to resolve inconsistencies; support for named arguments; and support for trailing commas in parameter lists, which adds consistency with support for trailing commas in other contexts, such as in arrays.\\n</p>\\n\\n<ul><li>Weak maps were added in PHP\xa08. A <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">WeakMap</code> holds references to objects, but these references do not prevent such objects from being garbage collected. This can provide performance improvements in scenarios where data is being cached; this is of particular relevance for object\u2013relational mappings (ORM).</li>\\n<li>Various adjustments to interfaces, such as adding support for creating <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">DateTime</code> objects from interfaces, and the addition of a <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">Stringable</code> interface that can be used for type hinting.</li>\\n<li>Various new functions including <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>str_contains</span><span>()</span></code>, <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>str_starts_with</span><span>()</span></code>, and <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>str_ends_with</span><span>()</span></code>; <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>fdiv</span><span>()</span></code>; <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>get_debug_type</span><span>()</span></code>; and <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>get_resource_id</span><span>()</span></code></li>\\n<li>Object implementation of <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>token_get_all</span><span>()</span></code></li></ul>\\n\\n<ul><li>Type annotations were also added into PHP\'s C source code itself to allow internal functions and methods to have \\"complete type information in reflection.\\"</li>\\n<li>Inheritance with private methods</li>\\n<li>Abstract methods in traits improvements</li></ul>\\n\\n<p>PHP 8.1 was released on November 25, 2021. It added support for enumerations (also called \\"enums\\"), declaring properties as <code>readonly</code> (which prevents modification of the property after initialization), and array unpacking with string keys. The new never type can be used to indicate that a function does not return.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>PHP 8.2 was released on December 8, 2022. New in this release are <code>readonly</code> classes (whose instance properties are implicitly readonly), disjunctive normal form (DNF) types, and the <code>random</code> extension, which provides a pseudorandom number generator with an object-oriented API, Sensitive Parameter value redaction, and a ton of other features.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Beginning on 28 June 2011, the PHP Development Team implemented a timeline for the release of new versions of PHP. Under this system, at least one release should occur every month. Once per year, a minor release should occur which may include new features. Every minor release should at least be supported for two years with security and bug fixes, followed by at least one year of only security fixes, for a total of a three-year release process for every minor release. No new features, unless small and self-contained, are to be introduced into a minor release during the three-year release process.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>The mascot of the PHP project is the <i>elePHPant</i>, a blue elephant with the PHP logo on its side, designed by Vincent Pontier in 1998. \\"The (PHP) letters were forming the shape of an elephant if viewed in a sideways angle.\\" The elePHPant is sometimes differently coloured when in plush toy form.\\n</p><p>Many variations of this mascot have been made over the years. Only the elePHPants based on the original design by Vincent Pontier are considered official by the community. These are collectable and some of them are extremely rare.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n\\n<p>The following \\"Hello, World!\\" program is written in PHP code embedded in an HTML document:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>However, as no requirement exists for PHP code to be embedded in HTML, the simplest version of <i>Hello, World!</i> may be written like this, with the closing tag <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>?&gt;</span></code> omitted as preferred in files containing pure PHP code.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The PHP interpreter only executes PHP code within its delimiters. Anything outside of its delimiters is not processed by PHP, although the non-PHP text is still subject to control structures described in PHP code. The most common delimiters are <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>&lt;?php</span></code> to open and <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>?&gt;</span></code> to close PHP sections. The shortened form <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>&lt;?</span></code> also exists. This short delimiter makes script files less portable since support for them can be disabled in the local PHP configuration and it is therefore discouraged. Conversely, there is no recommendation against the echo short tag <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>&lt;?=</span></code>. Prior to PHP\xa05.4.0, this short syntax for <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>echo</span></code> only works with the <code>short_open_tag</code> configuration setting enabled, while for PHP\xa05.4.0 and later it is always available. The purpose of all these delimiters is to separate PHP code from non-PHP content, such as JavaScript code or HTML markup. So the shortest \\"Hello, World!\\" program written in PHP is:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The first form of delimiters, <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>&lt;?php</span></code> and <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>?&gt;</span></code>, in XHTML and other XML documents, creates correctly formed XML processing instructions. This means that the resulting mixture of PHP code and other markups in the server-side file is itself well-formed XML.\\n</p><p><span id=\\"TYPE-HINTING\\"></span>\\nVariables are prefixed with a dollar symbol, and a type does not need to be specified in advance. PHP\xa05 introduced <i>type declarations</i> that allow functions to force their parameters to be objects of a specific class, arrays, interfaces or callback functions. However, before PHP\xa07, type declarations could not be used with scalar types such as integers or strings.\\n</p><p>Below is an example of how PHP variables are declared and initialized.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Unlike function and class names, variable names are case-sensitive. Both double-quoted (\\"\\") and heredoc strings provide the ability to interpolate a variable\'s value into the string. PHP treats newlines as whitespace in the manner of a free-form language, and statements are terminated by a semicolon. PHP has three types of comment syntax: <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>/* */</span></code> marks block and inline comments; <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>//</span></code> or <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>#</span></code> are used for one-line comments. The <code>echo</code> statement is one of several facilities PHP provides to output text.\\n</p><p>In terms of keywords and language syntax, PHP is similar to C-style syntax. <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>if</span></code> conditions, <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>for</span></code> and <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>while</span></code> loops and function returns are similar in syntax to languages such as C, C++, C#, Java and Perl.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>PHP is loosely typed. It stores integers in a platform-dependent range, either as a 32, 64 or 128-bit signed integer equivalent to the C-language long type. Unsigned integers are converted to signed values in certain situations, which is different behaviour to many other programming languages. Integer variables can be assigned using decimal (positive and negative), octal, hexadecimal, and binary notations.\\n</p><p>Floating-point numbers are also stored in a platform-specific range. They can be specified using floating-point notation, or two forms of scientific notation. PHP has a native Boolean type that is similar to the native Boolean types in Java and C++. Using the Boolean type conversion rules, non-zero values are interpreted as true and zero as false, as in Perl and C++.\\n</p><p>The null data type represents a variable that has no value; <code>NULL</code> is the only allowed value for this data type.\\n</p><p>Variables of the \\"resource\\" type represent references to resources from external sources. These are typically created by functions from a particular extension, and can only be processed by functions from the same extension; examples include file, image, and database resources.\\n</p><p>Arrays can contain elements of any type that PHP can handle, including resources, objects, and even other arrays. Order is preserved in lists of values and in hashes with both keys and values, and the two can be intermingled. PHP also supports strings, which can be used with single quotes, double quotes, nowdoc or heredoc syntax.\\n</p><p>The <b>Standard PHP Library</b> (SPL) attempts to solve standard problems and implements efficient data access interfaces and classes.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>PHP defines a large array of functions in the core language and many are also available in various extensions; these functions are well documented online PHP documentation. However, the built-in library has a wide variety of naming conventions and associated inconsistencies, as described under history above.\\n</p><p>Custom functions may be defined by the developer:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>As of 2024, the output of the above sample program is \\"I am currently 29 years old.\\"\\n</p><p>In lieu of function pointers, functions in PHP can be referenced by a string containing their name. In this manner, normal PHP functions can be used, for example, as callbacks or within function tables. User-defined functions may be created at any time without being prototyped. Functions may be defined inside code blocks, permitting a run-time decision as to whether or not a function should be defined. There is a <code>function_exists</code> function that determines whether a function with a given name has already been defined. Function calls must use parentheses, with the exception of zero-argument class constructor functions called with the PHP operator <code>new</code>, in which case parentheses are optional.\\n</p><p>Since PHP\xa04.0.1 <code>create_function()</code>, a thin wrapper around <code>eval()</code>, allowed normal PHP functions to be created during program execution; it was deprecated in PHP\xa07.2 and removed in PHP\xa08.0 in favor of syntax for anonymous functions or \\"closures\\" that can capture variables from the surrounding scope, which was added in PHP\xa05.3. Shorthand arrow syntax was added in PHP\xa07.4:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>In the example above, <code>getAdder()</code> function creates a closure using passed argument <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>$x</span></code>, which takes an additional argument <code class=\\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-php mw-content-ltr\\" id=\\"\\" style=\\"\\" dir=\\"ltr\\"><span>$y</span></code>, and returns the created closure to the caller. Such a function is a first-class object, meaning that it can be stored in a variable, passed as a parameter to other functions, etc.\\n</p><p>Unusually for a dynamically typed language, PHP supports type declarations on function parameters, which are enforced at runtime. This has been supported for classes and interfaces since PHP\xa05.0, for arrays since PHP\xa05.1, for \\"callables\\" since PHP\xa05.4, and scalar (integer, float, string and boolean) types since PHP\xa07.0. PHP\xa07.0 also has type declarations for function return types, expressed by placing the type name after the list of parameters, preceded by a colon. For example, the <code>getAdder</code> function from the earlier example could be annotated with types like so in PHP\xa07:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>By default, scalar type declarations follow weak typing principles. So, for example, if a parameter\'s type is <code>int</code>, PHP would allow not only integers, but also convertible numeric strings, floats or booleans to be passed to that function, and would convert them. However, PHP\xa07 has a \\"strict typing\\" mode which, when used, disallows such conversions for function calls and returns within a file.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Basic object-oriented programming functionality was added in PHP\xa03 and improved in PHP\xa04. This allowed for PHP to gain further abstraction, making creative tasks easier for programmers using the language. Object handling was completely rewritten for PHP\xa05, expanding the feature set and enhancing performance. In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like value types. The drawback of this method was that code had to make heavy use of PHP\'s \\"reference\\" variables if it wanted to modify an object it was passed rather than creating a copy of it. In the new approach, objects are referenced by handle, and not by value.\\n</p><p>PHP\xa05 introduced private and protected member variables and methods, along with abstract classes, final classes, abstract methods, and final methods. It also introduced a standard way of declaring constructors and destructors, similar to that of other object-oriented languages such as C++, and a standard exception handling model. Furthermore, PHP\xa05 added interfaces and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. Objects implementing ArrayAccess can be used with array syntax and objects implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate can be used with the <code>foreach</code> language construct. There is no virtual table feature in the engine, so static variables are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.\\n</p><p>If the developer creates a copy of an object using the reserved word <code>clone</code>, the Zend engine will check whether a <code>__clone()</code> method has been defined. If not, it will call a default <code>__clone()</code> which will copy the object\'s properties. If a <code>__clone()</code> method is defined, then it will be responsible for setting the necessary properties in the created object. For convenience, the engine will supply a function that imports the properties of the source object, so the programmer can start with a by-value replica of the source object and only override properties that need to be changed.\\n</p><p>The visibility of PHP properties and methods is defined using the keywords <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, and <code>protected</code>. The default is public, if only var is used; <code>var</code> is a synonym for <code>public</code>. Items declared <code>public</code> can be accessed everywhere. <code>protected</code> limits access to inherited classes (and to the class that defines the item). <code>private</code> limits visibility only to the class that defines the item. Objects of the same type have access to each other\'s private and protected members even though they are not the same instance.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The following is a basic example of object-oriented programming in PHP\xa08:\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>This program outputs the following:\\n</p>\\n<pre>Students:\\nHello, my name is Alice, I learn Computer Science\\nHello, my name is Bob, I learn Computer Science\\nHello, my name is Charlie, I learn Business Studies\\nTeachers:\\nHello, my name is Dan, I teach Computer Science, Information Security\\nHello, my name is Erin, I teach Computer Science, 3D Graphics Programming\\nHello, my name is Frankie, I teach Online Marketing, Business Studies, E-commerce\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>The only complete PHP implementation is the original, known simply as PHP. It is the most widely used and is powered by the Zend Engine. To disambiguate it from other implementations, it is sometimes unofficially called \\"Zend PHP\\". The Zend Engine compiles PHP source code on-the-fly into an internal format that it can execute, thus it works as an interpreter. It is also the \\"reference implementation\\" of PHP, as PHP has no formal specification, and so the semantics of Zend PHP define the semantics of PHP. Due to the complex and nuanced semantics of PHP, defined by how Zend works, it is difficult for competing implementations to offer complete compatibility.\\n</p><p>PHP\'s single-request-per-script-execution model, and the fact that the Zend Engine is an interpreter, leads to inefficiency; as a result, various products have been developed to help improve PHP performance. In order to speed up execution time and not have to compile the PHP source code every time the web page is accessed, PHP scripts can also be deployed in the PHP engine\'s internal format by using an opcode cache, which works by caching the compiled form of a PHP script (opcodes) in shared memory to avoid the overhead of parsing and compiling the code every time the script runs. An opcode cache, Zend Opcache, is built into PHP since version 5.5. Another example of a widely used opcode cache is the Alternative PHP Cache (APC), which is available as a PECL extension.\\n</p><p>While Zend PHP is still the most popular implementation, several other implementations have been developed. Some of these are compilers or support JIT compilation, and hence offer performance benefits over Zend PHP at the expense of lacking full PHP compatibility. Alternative implementations include the following:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>HHVM (HipHop Virtual Machine)\xa0\u2013 developed at Facebook and available as open source, it converts PHP code into a high-level bytecode (commonly known as an intermediate language), which is then translated into x86-64 machine code dynamically at runtime by a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, resulting in up to 6\xd7 performance improvements. However, since version 7.2 Zend has outperformed HHVM, and HHVM\xa03.24 is the last version to officially support PHP.\\n<ul><li>HipHop\xa0\u2013 developed at Facebook and available as open source, it transforms the PHP scripts into C++ code and then compiles the resulting code, reducing the server load up to 50%. In early 2013, Facebook deprecated it in favour of HHVM due to multiple reasons, including deployment difficulties and lack of support for the whole PHP language, including the <code>create_function()</code> and <code>eval()</code> constructs.</li></ul></li>\\n<li>Parrot\xa0\u2013 a virtual machine designed to run dynamic languages efficiently; the cross-translator Pipp transforms the PHP source code into the Parrot intermediate representation, which is then translated into the Parrot\'s bytecode and executed by the virtual machine.</li>\\n<li>PeachPie \u2013 a second-generation compiler to .NET Common Intermediate Language (CIL) bytecode, built on the Roslyn platform; successor of Phalanger, sharing several architectural components</li>\\n<li>Phalanger\xa0\u2013 compiles PHP into .Net Common Intermediate Language bytecode; predecessor of PeachPie</li>\\n<li>Quercus\xa0\u2013 compiles PHP into Java bytecode</li></ul>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\\">\\n<p>PHP is free software released under the PHP License, which stipulates that:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\"templatequote\\"><p> Products derived from this software may not be called \\"PHP\\", nor may \\"PHP\\" appear in their name, without prior written permission from group@php.net. You may indicate that your software works in conjunction with PHP by saying \\"Foo for PHP\\" instead of calling it \\"PHP Foo\\" or \\"phpfoo\\".\\n</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This restriction on the use of \\"PHP\\" makes the PHP License incompatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL), while the Zend License is incompatible due to an advertising clause similar to that of the original BSD license.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>PHP includes various free and open-source libraries in its source distribution or uses them in resulting PHP binary builds. PHP is fundamentally an Internet-aware system with built-in modules for accessing File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers and many database servers, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite (which is an embedded database), LDAP servers, and others. Numerous functions are familiar to C programmers, such as those in the stdio family, are available in standard PHP builds.\\n</p><p>PHP allows developers to write extensions in C to add functionality to the PHP language. PHP extensions can be compiled statically into PHP or loaded dynamically at runtime. Numerous extensions have been written to add support for the Windows API, process management on Unix-like operating systems, multibyte strings (Unicode), cURL, and several popular compression formats. Other PHP features made available through extensions include integration with Internet Relay Chat (IRC), dynamic generation of images and Adobe Flash content, <i>PHP Data Objects</i> (PDO) as an abstraction layer used for accessing databases, and even speech synthesis. Some of the language\'s core functions, such as those dealing with strings and arrays, are also implemented as extensions. The PHP Extension Community Library (PECL) project is a repository for extensions to the PHP language.\\n</p><p>Some other projects, such as <i>Zephir</i>, provide the ability for PHP extensions to be created in a high-level language and compiled into native PHP extensions. Such an approach, instead of writing PHP extensions directly in C, simplifies the development of extensions and reduces the time required for programming and testing.\\n</p><p>By December 2018 the PHP Group consisted of ten people: Thies C. Arntzen, Stig Bakken, Shane Caraveo, Andi Gutmans, Rasmus Lerdorf, Sam Ruby, Sascha Schumann, Zeev Suraski, Jim Winstead, and Andrei Zmievski.\\n</p><p>Zend Technologies provides a PHP Certification based on PHP\xa07 exam (and previously based on PHP\xa05.5) for programmers to become certified PHP developers.\\n</p>\\n\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1229112069\\">\\n<p>On 26 November 2021, the JetBrains blog announced the creation of The PHP Foundation, which will sponsor the design and development of PHP.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>The foundation hires \\"Core Developers\\" to work on the PHP language\'s core repository. Roman Pronskiy, a member of the foundation\'s board, said that they aim to pay \\"market salaries\\" to developers.\\n</p><p>The response to the foundation has mostly been positive, with the foundation being praised for better supporting the language and helping to stop the decrease in the language\'s popularity. However, it has also been criticised for adding breaking changes to minor versions of PHP, such as in PHP 8.2 where initialising members of a class out-with the original class scope would cause depreciation errors, these changes impacted a number of open source projects including WordPress.\\n\\n</p><p>Germany\'s Sovereign Tech Fund provided more than 200,000 Euros to support the PHP Foundation.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>There are two primary ways for adding support for PHP to a web server\xa0\u2013 as a native web server module, or as a CGI executable. PHP has a direct module interface called server application programming interface (SAPI), which is supported by many web servers including Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS and iPlanet Web Server. Some other web servers, such as OmniHTTPd, support the Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI), which is Microsoft\'s web server module interface. If PHP has no module support for a web server, it can always be used as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) or FastCGI processor; in that case, the web server is configured to use PHP\'s CGI executable to process all requests to PHP files.\\n</p><p>PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative FastCGI implementation for PHP, bundled with the official PHP distribution since version 5.3.3. When compared to the older FastCGI implementation, it contains some additional features, mostly useful for heavily loaded web servers.\\n</p><p>When using PHP for command-line scripting, a PHP command-line interface (CLI) executable is needed. PHP supports a CLI server application programming interface (SAPI) since PHP\xa04.3.0. The main focus of this SAPI is developing shell applications using PHP. There are quite a few differences between the CLI SAPI and other SAPIs, although they do share many of the same behaviours.\\n</p><p>PHP has a direct module interface called SAPI for different web servers; in case of PHP\xa05 and Apache\xa02.0 on Windows, it is provided in form of a DLL file called <span>php5apache2.dll</span>, which is a module that, among other functions, provides an interface between PHP and the web server, implemented in a form that the server understands. This form is what is known as a SAPI.\\n</p><p>There are different kinds of SAPIs for various web server extensions. For example, in addition to those listed above, other SAPIs for the PHP language include the Common Gateway Interface and command-line interface.\\n</p><p>PHP can also be used for writing desktop graphical user interface (GUI) applications, by using the PHP-GTK extension. PHP-GTK is not included in the official PHP distribution, and as an extension, it can be used only with PHP versions 5.1.0 and newer. The most common way of installing PHP-GTK is by compiling it from the source code.\\n</p><p>When PHP is installed and used in cloud environments, software development kits (SDKs) are provided for using cloud-specific features. For example:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>Amazon Web Services provides the AWS SDK for PHP</li>\\n<li>Microsoft Azure can be used with the Windows Azure SDK for PHP.</li></ul>\\n<p>Numerous configuration options are supported, affecting both core PHP features and extensions. Configuration file <code>php.ini</code> is searched for in different locations, depending on the way PHP is used. The configuration file is split into various sections, while some of the configuration options can be also set within the web server configuration.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. It can also be used for command-line scripting and client-side graphical user interface (GUI) applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize and extend for their own use.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Originally designed to create dynamic web pages, PHP now focuses mainly on server-side scripting, and it is similar to other server-side scripting languages that provide dynamic content from a web server to a client, such as Python, Microsoft\'s ASP.NET, Sun Microsystems\' JavaServer Pages, and <code>mod_perl</code>. PHP has also attracted the development of many software frameworks that provide building blocks and a design structure to promote rapid application development (RAD). Some of these include PRADO, CakePHP, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Yii Framework, Phalcon and Laminas, offering features similar to other web frameworks.\\n</p><p>The LAMP architecture has become popular in the web industry as a way of deploying web applications. PHP is commonly used as the <i>P</i> in this bundle alongside Linux, Apache and MySQL, although the <i>P</i> may also refer to Python, Perl, or some mix of the three. Similar packages, WAMP and MAMP, are also available for Windows and macOS, with the first letter standing for the respective operating system. Although both PHP and Apache are provided as part of the macOS base install, users of these packages seek a simpler installation mechanism that can be more easily kept up to date.\\n</p><p>For specific and more advanced usage scenarios, PHP offers a well-defined and documented way for writing custom extensions in C or C++. Besides extending the language itself in form of additional libraries, extensions are providing a way for improving execution speed where it is critical and there is room for improvements by using a true compiled language. PHP also offers well-defined ways for embedding itself into other software projects. That way PHP can be easily used as an internal scripting language for another project, also providing tight interfacing with the project\'s specific internal data structures.\\n</p><p>PHP received mixed reviews due to lacking support for multithreading at the core language level, though using threads is made possible by the \\"pthreads\\" PECL extension.\\n</p><p>A command line interface, php-cli, and two ActiveX Windows Script Host scripting engines for PHP have been produced.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>PHP is used for Web content management systems including MediaWiki, WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Moodle, eZ Publish, eZ Platform, and SilverStripe.\\n</p><p>As of January\xa02013, PHP was used in more than 240\xa0million websites (39% of those sampled) and was installed on 2.1\xa0million web servers.\\n</p><p>As of 23\xa0June\xa02024 (seven months after PHP 8.3\'s release), PHP is used as the server-side programming language on 76.2% of websites where the language could be determined; PHP 7 is the most used version of the language with 53.9% of websites using PHP being on that version, while 31.2% use PHP 8, 14.8% use PHP 5 and 0.2% use PHP 4.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p><br>\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>In 2019, 11% of all vulnerabilities listed by the National Vulnerability Database were linked to PHP; historically, about 30% of all vulnerabilities listed since 1996 in this database are linked to PHP. Technical security flaws of the language itself or of its core libraries are not frequent (22 in 2009, about 1% of the total although PHP applies to about 20% of programs listed). Recognizing that programmers make mistakes, some languages include taint checking to automatically detect the lack of input validation which induces many issues. Such a feature is being developed for PHP, but its inclusion into a release has been rejected several times in the past.\\n</p><p>There are advanced protection patches such as Suhosin and Hardening-Patch, specially designed for web hosting environments.\\n</p><p>Historically, old versions of PHP had some configuration parameters and default values for such runtime settings that made some PHP applications prone to security issues. Among these, <code>magic_quotes_gpc</code> and <code>register_globals</code> configuration directives were the best known; the latter made any URL parameters become PHP variables, opening a path for serious security vulnerabilities by allowing an attacker to set the value of any uninitialized global variable and interfere with the execution of a PHP script. Support for \\"magic quotes\\" and \\"register globals\\" settings has been deprecated since PHP\xa05.3.0, and removed from PHP\xa05.4.0.\\n</p><p>Another example for the potential runtime-settings vulnerability comes from failing to disable PHP execution (for example by using the <code>engine</code> configuration directive) for the directory where uploaded files are stored; enabling it can result in the execution of malicious code embedded within the uploaded files. The best practice is to either locate the image directory outside of the document root available to the web server and serve it via an intermediary script or disable PHP execution for the directory which stores the uploaded files.\\n</p><p>Also, enabling the dynamic loading of PHP extensions (via <code>enable_dl</code> configuration directive) in a shared web hosting environment can lead to security issues.\\n</p><p>Implied type conversions that result in different values being treated as equal, sometimes against the programmer\'s intent, can lead to security issues. For example, the result of the comparison <span><code>\'0e1234\' == \'0\'</code></span> is <code>true</code>, because strings that are parsable as numbers are converted to numbers; in this case, the first compared value is treated as scientific notation having the value (<span><span data-sort-value=\\"5000000000000000000\u2660\\"></span>0<span>\xd7</span>10<sup>1234</sup></span>), which is zero. Errors like this resulted in authentication vulnerabilities in Simple Machines Forum, Typo3 and phpBB when MD5 password hashes were compared. The recommended way is to use <code>hash_equals()</code> (for timing attack safety), <code>strcmp</code> or the identity operator (<code>===</code>), as <span><code>\'0e1234\' === \'0\'</code></span> results in <code>false</code>.\\n</p><p>In a 2013 analysis of over 170,000 website defacements, published by Zone-H, the most frequently (53%) used technique was the exploitation of file inclusion vulnerability, mostly related to insecure usage of the PHP language constructs <code>include</code>, <code>require</code>, and <code>allow_url_fopen</code>.\\n</p><p>It is highly recommended to migrate to PHP 8.1 or later and use <code>random_int()</code> instead of <code>rand()</code> or <code>mt_rand()</code>, as the latter functions are not cryptographically secure. There are two attacks that can be performed over PHP entropy sources: \\"seed attack\\" and \\"state recovery attack\\". As of 2012, a $250 GPU can perform up to 2<sup>30</sup> MD5 calculations per second, while a $750 GPU can perform four times as many calculations at the same time. In combination with a \\"birthday attack\\" this can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.\\n</p><p>As of 23\xa0June\xa02024, (7 months after PHP 8.3 release) W3Techs reports that 78.9% of websites using PHP, use versions 8.0 or older (which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team). PHP Version 5 is still used by 14.8% of all websites. \\n</p><p>Zend offers paid active long-term support for PHP (PHP LTS) that includes security patches:\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>optionally paid for supported PHP versions;</li>\\n<li>paid only for legacy PHP branches including:\\n<ul><li>8.0 until the end of 2025;</li>\\n<li>7.4, 7.3 and 7.2 until the end of 2026.</li></ul></li></ul>\\n<p>The period of paid support for each branch, starting from the release of the initial stable version, is at least 5 years.\\n</p>\\n<link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1050355024\\">\\n\\n<p><br>\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><link rel=\\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\\" href=\\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1215172403\\"><cite id=\\"CITEREFFord2015\\" class=\\"citation journal cs1\\">Ford, Paul (June 11, 2015). \\"What is Code?\\". <i>Bloomberg Businessweek</i>. <q>What\'s the Absolute Minimum I Must Know About PHP?</q></cite><span title=\\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.jtitle=Bloomberg+Businessweek&amp;rft.atitle=What+is+Code%3F&amp;rft.date=2015-06-11&amp;rft.aulast=Ford&amp;rft.aufirst=Paul&amp;rft_id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fgraphics%2F2015-paul-ford-what-is-code%2F&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3APHP\\"></span></li></ul>\\n\\n<ul><li><span><span>Official website</span></span> <span typeof=\\"mw:File/Frameless\\"></span></li>\\n<li>PHP at Curlie</li></ul>","image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/PHP-logo.svg/711px-PHP-logo.svg.png","repositories":[{"name_with_owner":"danielmiessler/SecLists","url":"https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists","description":"SecLists is the security tester\'s companion.

It enforces memory safety\u2014meaning that all references point to valid memory\u2014without a garbage collector. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its \\"borrow checker\\" tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation.\\n</p><p>Rust was influenced by ideas from functional programming, including immutability, higher-order functions, and algebraic data types. It is popular for systems programming. Rust does not enforce a programming paradigm, but supports object oriented programming with its structs, enums, traits and methods. Functional programming is supported via immutability, pure functions, higher order functions and pattern matching. \\n</p><p>Software developer Graydon Hoare created Rust as a personal project while working at Mozilla Research in 2006. Mozilla officially sponsored the project in 2009.

<i title=\\"English pronunciation respelling\\"><span>SKAH</span>-lah</i>) is a strong statically typed high-level general-purpose programming language that supports both object-oriented programming and functional programming. Designed to be concise, many of Scala\'s design decisions are intended to address criticisms of Java.\\n</p><p>Scala source code can be compiled to Java bytecode and run on a Java virtual machine (JVM). Scala can also be transpiled to JavaScript to run in a browser, or compiled directly to a native executable. When running on the JVM, Scala provides language interoperability with Java so that libraries written in either language may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code. Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a syntax termed <i>curly-brace</i> which is similar to the language C. Since Scala 3, there is also an option to use the off-side rule (indenting) to structure blocks, and its use is advised. Martin Odersky has said that this turned out to be the most productive change introduced in Scala 3.\\n</p><p>Unlike Java, Scala has many features of functional programming languages (like Scheme, Standard ML, and Haskell), including currying, immutability, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching. It also has an advanced type system supporting algebraic data types, covariance and contravariance, higher-order types (but not higher-rank types), anonymous types, operator overloading, optional parameters, named parameters, raw strings, and an experimental exception-only version of algebraic effects that can be seen as a more powerful version of Java\'s checked exceptions.\\n</p><p>The name

Swift compiles to machine code, as it is an LLVM-based compiler. Swift was first released in June 2014, and the Swift toolchain has shipped in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014.\\n</p><p>Apple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably dynamic dispatch, widespread late binding, extensible programming, and similar features, but in a \\"safer\\" way, making it easier to catch software bugs; Swift has features addressing some common programming errors like null pointer dereferencing and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the pyramid of doom. Swift supports the concept of protocol extensibility, an extensibility system that can be applied to types, structs and classes, which Apple promotes as a real change in programming paradigms they term \\"protocol-oriented programming\\" (similar to traits and type classes).\\n</p><p>Swift was introduced at Apple\'s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). It underwent an upgrade to version 1.2 during 2014 and a major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. It was initially a proprietary language, but version 2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3, 2015, for Apple\'s platforms and Linux.\\n</p><p>Through version 3.0 the syntax of Swift went through significant evolution, with the core team making source stability a focus in later versions. In the first quarter of 2018 Swift surpassed Objective-C in measured popularity.\\n</p><p>Swift 4.0, released in 2017, introduced several changes to some built-in classes and structures. Code written with previous versions of Swift can be updated using the migration functionality built into Xcode. Swift 5, released in March 2019, introduced a stable binary interface on Apple platforms, allowing the Swift runtime to be incorporated into Apple operating systems. It is source compatible with Swift 4.\\n</p><p>Swift 5.1 was officially released in September 2019. Swift 5.1 builds on the previous version of Swift 5 by extending the stable features of the language to compile-time with the introduction of module stability. The introduction of module stability makes it possible to create and share binary frameworks that will work with future releases of Swift.\\n</p><p>Swift 5.5, officially announced by Apple at the 2021 WWDC, significantly expands language support for concurrency and asynchronous code, notably introducing a unique version of the actor model.\\n</p><p>Swift 5.9, was released in September 2023 and includes a macro system, generic parameter packs, and ownership features like the new <code>consume</code> operator.\\n</p><p>The current version, Swift 5.10, was released in March 2024. This version improves the language\'s concurrency model, allowing for full data isolation to prevent data races. It is also the last release before Swift 6. Version 5.10 is currently available for macOS, Windows and for Linux.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n","image_url":"","repositories":[{"name_with_owner":"ChartsOrg/Charts","url":"https://github.com/ChartsOrg/Charts","description":"Beautiful charts for iOS/tvOS/OSX!

class=\\"mw-empty-elt\\">\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><b>TypeScript</b> is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. Because TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, all JavaScript programs are syntactically valid TypeScript, but they can fail to type-check for safety reasons.\\n</p><p>TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js, Deno or Bun). Multiple options are available for transpilation. The default TypeScript Compiler can be used, or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.\\n</p><p>TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js library modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.\\n</p><p>The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n","image_url":"","repositories":[{"name_with_owner":"freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp","url":"https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp","description":"freeCodeCamp.org\'s open-source codebase and curriculum.
